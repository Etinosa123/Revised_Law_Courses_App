    <string name="sale1"><b>What is a Sale Contract?</b>
    \nA contract of sale is a special kind of contract involving the sale of chattel called goods. A
contract of sale includes the sale itself and an agreement to sell. By virtue of <i>section 1(1) of the Sale
of Goods Act 1893 (hereinafter referred to as SGA)</i>, a contract of sale is defined as a contract
whereby a person called the seller transfers the property in the goods or agrees to transfer the
property (ownership) in goods to a person called the buyer in exchange for money consideration
called the price\n
    \nSection 1(3) of the Act states that, “Where under a contract of sale the property in
the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer, the contract is called a “sale”; but where the
transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some conditions
thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is called an “agreement to sell.”\n
    \nIn effect, either sale or an agreement to sell must be present for there to be a sale contract. The
        above follows the reasoning that both components cannot be present at the same time.\n
        \na. A contract of sale, in which the ownership or title called the property in the goods sold is
transferred from the seller to the buyer at the time of the contract. Here, the contract of sale is
    absolute.\n
    \nb. An agreement to sell, in which the transfer of the title called the property to the goods is to
takes place „at a future time‟ or subject to some conditions thereafter to be fulfilled. It is thus
    a conditional sale.\n
    \nc. The consideration in a contract of sale of goods is money, the price, but it can be partly
money and something else; but trade by barter will not fall within the definition of sale of
goods\n
    \nWhile construing the provision of section 1 SGA, Benjamin opines that the term contract of sale is a general expression embracing both a “sale” and an “agreement to sell". This position was judicially affirmed by the Nigerian Supreme Court in <i>Afrotec Technical Services Nig Ltd v. M.I.A. &amp; Sons Ltd [2000] 15 NWLR (Pt. 692) 730</i> wherein it was held inter alia “Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer the contract is called a sale, but where the transfer of property is to take place at a future time or subject to conditions thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is an agreement to sell".\n
        \n<b>Distinctions among absolute, credit and conditional sale</b>
        \n1.	Absolute sale: this is a sale contract that is not attached to any condition precedent or promises.\n
        \n2. Credit sale: A credit sale is based on standard, piecemeal or instalmental payment of the price. In a credit sale ownership has been transferred and the seller cannot retrieve the goods sold but can sue for the price.\n
    \n3.	Conditional sale: this is accommodated under an agreement to sell. It is based on promise for promise. It is an example of executory consideration. When a party expressly makes the payment of the purchase price a condition precedent for the transfer of ownership to the buyer, it is a conditional sale\n
    \nFrom the statutory definition of a contract of sale, the following terms can be extracted. These terms can be regarded as the essential elements of a sale contract. These include:\n
   \n 1. Property,\n
    \n2. Price\n
    \n 3.Transfer,\n
    \n 4. Goods\n
    \n<b>Property</b>
   \nProperty can be used in two senses. In the first sense, it can include one‟s possession. Property in the context of sale of goods law means ownership as distinct from possession. <i>Section 62 SGA</i> defines property to mean general property in goods and not merely a special property. General property essentially refers to the absolute legal interest or ownership in the goods in question. Special property on the other hand refers to limited right or interest other than absolute ownership. The totality of ownership right can be understood from three perspectives:\n
    \n1. The right to use and enjoy the goods in question. Possession is only one-tenth of ownership\n
    \n2. The right to alienate or path with the goods in question\n
   \n3. The right to destroy the goods in question\n
   \nWhen these three features are present in one person, a person can be said to have property in the goods.\n
    \n<b>Price</b>
    \nPrice is a basic element of a sale of goods contract and it must be in monetary consideration. Price is the money consideration paid by the buyer in exchange for the goods supplied to him. Specifically, section 8(1) of the Act provides that: (1) “The price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the contract, or may be left to be fixed in manner thereby agreed, or may be determined in the course of dealing between the parties.”\n
    \n<b>Transfer</b>
    \nTransfer as used in the Sale of Goods Act means the symbolic delivery of the title or ownership in the goods by the seller to the buyer. Transfer must be distinguished from delivery. This is because delivery is the transfer of possession and not ownership in the goods. The sale of goods law contemplates transfer of ownership not transfer of possession\n
    \n<b>Goods</b>
    \nThe subject of the contract of sale is goods. It is therefore important therefore to understand the nature and scope of goods as contemplated under the Sale of Goods Act.\n
    \n<b>Features of Goods</b>
    \n There are three major features of goods which are also common to chattels. These include:\n
    \n1.	Tangibility: good by their very nature are moveable. Albeit some difficulties may be encountered in the course of moving some goods because of their very nature, but it must be moved ultimately notwithstanding any difficulty encountered in an attempt to do so\n
    \n2.	Physical possession: goods can be possessed physically. The hallmark of goods is that they can be easily felt, touched and seen.\n
   \n3.	Transferability: good can be transferred physically.\n
    \nGoods have been defined under <i>section 62 SGA</i> as follows: “all chattels personal other than things in action and money, and includes emblements, industrial growing crops and things attached to or forming part of the land such as agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale”. In effect, the term “Goods” embraces widely varying objects like;\n
    \na.	Personal chattels: personal chattels include clothes, shoes, aircraft, motor cars, machinery, ships, books, furniture, etc\n
    \nb.	Emblements: emblements comprise crops and vegetables produced by the labour of man and does not span beyond the present year\n
   \nc.	Industrial growing crops. The term “industrial growing crops,” has not yet been judicially defined, but presumably it may include crops which may be harvested outside the annual period\n
    \nThe term goods do not include:\n
    \n1.	Things or choses in action: choses in action like bills of exchange, patent, copyright, trademarks and the likes, cannot be regarded as goods since they cannot be possessed physically\n
    \n2.	 Real property: real property is completely outside the ambit of the Act. In other words, land or any interest therein is excluded from the definition of goods.\n
    \n3.	Money: by the provision of the sale of goods law, money does not fall into the category of goods. Money is used to acquire goods. It is not goods itself.\n
    \n4.	Things forming part of the land: things forming part of the land cannot be regarded as goods because things attached to the land form part of the land. Since land is a real property, it does not qualify as goods so also are things attached to the land\n
    \n<b>Classification of Goods</b>
    \nThere are different categories of goods and they are provided for by virtue of <i>section 5(1) SGA</i>. That section provides thus: “The goods which form the subject of a contract of sale may be either existing goods, owned or possessed by the seller, or goods to be manufactured or acquire by the seller  after the making of the contract of sale, in this Act called “future goods.” From the foregoing, goods are classified broadly into two categories\n
    \n(a) Future Goods\n
    \n(b) Existing Goods.\n
    \n<b>Future Goods</b>
    \nThese are goods not yet in existence, or have not yet been acquired by the seller at the time the contract is concluded. Future goods include goods that are yet to be manufactured or yet to be discovered by either party to the contract of sale.\n
    \n<b>Existing Goods</b>
    \n Existing goods are goods that are already in existence or have been acquired by the seller at the time the sale contract was concluded. Existing goods are further subdivided into three sub-categories, namely;\n
    \n1.	Specific Goods: These are goods identified and agreed upon by the parties at the time the contract of sale was made. The agreement and identification of the goods could be in the form or measurement of the goods in question, or the description of the goods in question. In <i>Howell v Coupland (1876) 1 Q.B. 258</i>, the court held that a contract for the sale of 200 tons of potatoes to be grown on a particular piece of land was a contract for the sale of specific goods.In the Nigeria case of <i>Ajayi v. Eburu (1964) 1 MWLR 41</i>, a Benin High Court held that a sale of gold dust in the form of trinket amounted to the sale of specific goods.\n
    \n2.	 Unascertained Goods: Unascertained goods are the opposite of specific goods. In other words, these are goods that are yet to be identified or agreed upon by the parties at the time the contract is concluded. In respect to unascertained goods, the parties are not in agreement as to the quantity of the goods in question.\n
    \n3.	Ascertained Goods: When unascertained goods are duly appropriated to the contract, they become ascertained. Ascertained goods enjoy the same legal status as specific goods. In <i>Marabita v. Imperial Ottoma Bank (1878) Ex. D 164 at 172,</i> the court defined appropriation to mean the act of setting aside

    <string name="sims">Transactions Similar to Sale Contract</string>
    <string name="sims1">1. Sale and Bailment\n
    \n2. Sale and Trade by Barter\n
    \n3. Sale and Hire Purchase\n
    \n4. Sale and Contract for Work done or Skill\n
    \n5. Sale and Loan Contract or Chattel Mortgage\n
   \n<b>Sale and Bailment</b>
    \n A bailment contract is a contract whereby a party called a bailor gives out the custody or the possession of his goods to another party called the bailee for safe keeping, maintenance or otherwise, and on the condition that the bailee will return the goods on demand. In <i>Coggs v. Bernard (1703) 92 E.R. 108</i>, Holt, CJ, essentially classified bailment into two, either gratuitous or contractual, i.e. for good consideration. Where a bailment is for a fee, it is an enforceable contract.\n
    \nOguntade JSC in <i>Marthem Industries v. M.F. Kent West Africa Ltd [2005] 10 NWLR (Pt. 934) 645 at 667</i> made a more comprehensive classification of bailment where he classified bailment into five, namely;\n
    \n 1. Bailment by depositum: this occurs when the bailor gives out the goods for safe keeping with or without reward. But when it a bank, charges will apply. Cold room business is a typical example of bailment by depositum.\n
    \n 2. Bailment by mandatum: this occurs where the bailee has, without reward, to do something for the bailor with the chattel bailed.\n
   \n3. Bailment by commondatum: this occurs where the bailor without recompense lends a chattel to the bailee for him to use.\n
   \n 4. Bailment by pignus: this is sometimes called vadium or pawn. It occurs where the bailee holds the chattel confided to him as a security for loan or deed or the fulfilment of an obligation.\n
   \n5. Bailment by locatio conductio: this occurs where chattels are levied for reward.\n
    \nThere can also be bailement by lodging or parking which occurs where the bailor parks his car in bailee‟s parking lodge for a fee.\n
   \n<b>Sale and Trade by Barter</b>\n
    \n In primordial times most businesses were transacted on the basis of exchange of goods for goods. It has been agreed that exchange of goods for goods is not a sale contract.\n
    \nAny contract in which there is no price as a consideration, it would be concluded that no contract exist. No price no contract. However, where the consideration is partly money and partly exchange, it is acceptable as a sale contract. Thus, in <i>Sheldon v. Cox (1824) 3 E &amp; B 420</i>, a contract for the transfer of property in a house in exchange for a mere and 40 guineas plus 5 more guineas if the house was suitable was held to be a sale contract and not an exchange.\n
   \nThe importance of having money consideration is that the buyer can rely on the implied term of the contract to avoid liability. But in trade by barter, money consideration is usually absent\n
    \n<b>Sale and Hire Purchase</b>
    \nOne of the similarities between a sale contract and hire purchase is that both transactions involve the subject matter of goods. Another similarity is that in both contract, the money consideration is called the price. The third, though debatable, is that in both transactions the parties contemplate or envisaged the transfer of property in the goods from the seller to the buyer.\n
   \nHowever, the main difference between the contract of sale and hire purchase is that in a sale contract the transfer of property in the goods from the seller to the buyer is imperative or mandatory upon the payment of the full price subject to all other variables.\n
\nAnother point of difference that can be drawn between a sale contract and a hire purchase is that a person who obtains good under the former could not insist on returning them and so absolve himself from the obligation to pay the price unless he was exercising his statutory right of rejection. In a contract of hire purchase, there is a statutory right accruing to the hirer to terminate the contract at any time if he so wishes subject however to liability for certain penalties.\n
    \n<b>Sale and Contract for Work done or Skill</b>
    \nThe subject matter of a sale contract is goods. Therefore at all time in a sale contract, the seller must transfer goods to the buyer. A contract involving the seller exchanging his service, skill or work to the buyer is not a contract for sale of goods. In other words, a line of distinction must be drawn between contract for the sale of goods and a contract for service\n
   \nIn <i>Ernest Friedrischdorf &amp; Co Ltd v. Fuja (1957) LLR 115</i>, a contract to press 4,000 gramophone records from tape recording was held to be a contract for the sale of goods.\n
    \nThe final test can be summarized as follows: where the buyer is paying only for the goods irrespective of the skill and expertise of the seller, the production of the goods, the contract is for the sale of goods. But where the buyer is actually paying for the skill and expertise of the seller and the goods is only a vehicle or means of appreciating the said expertise or skill, then, it is contract for work done or skill\n
    \n<b>Sale and Loan Contract or Chattel Mortgage</b>
    \nBy virtue of section 61(4) SGA, the provisions of the Act relating to contracts of sale do not apply to any transaction in form of contract of sale which is intended to operate by way of mortgage, pledge, charge, or other security. The implication of this provision is that mortgage does not fall within the meaning of a sale of goods contract.\n
</string>
    <string name="sterm">Terms of a Sale Contract</string>
    <string name="sterm1">The sale of goods contract like any other contract is governed by the terms and conditions of the contract that the parties entered or agreed upon. The primary duty of the court is to interpret these terms and conditions for the parties and where appropriate enforce them on their behalf\n
   \nIt is in this light that a line of distinction ought to be drawn between mere representations and terms of the contract properly so-called. This is because the court will only enforce the terms of the contract agreed upon by the parties and not mere representations\n
   \nIt is the law that these statements attract no legal consequences because of the age long maxim – “simplex commendatio non obligat” as well as the common law axiom of caveat emptor. In the law of sale, the law permits the seller to say whatever he likes about his goods (puff) without necessarily amounting to misrepresentation\n
    \n<b>Distinguishing representation from terms of a contract</b>
   \nThe dividing line between terms of contract and representation is very narrow. Often than not, representations are treated as pre-contract statements made by the seller that attract no contractual or legal liability. The popular cliché is simplex commendatio non obligat, in other words, a seller is entitled to commend or praise his goods without suffering any legal disability\n
   \n In the course of holding such seller accountable for his misstatement, a dividing line must be drawn between mere statement or mere representation and terms of the contract properly so-called. In holding this, the court must take cognisance of the fact that it is the manifest intention of the parties that is supreme. However, the following guides have been fashioned by the court\n
    \n1.	The courts have often been asked to focus on the preliminary issue of when a statement in question was made. In other words, at what stage was the statement made. It is believed that statements made at the preliminary stages of negotiations are better left in the realm of mere representation. The deficiency in this test is exposed by the very fact that it is not so much about as to when a statement was made, but rather the substance and the degree of importance of the statement made\n
    \n2.The second test is the test propounded by the learned authors of the leading book on “Law of Contract”, Cheshire and Fifoot. They propounded a test that focuses on whether the statement made by the seller was subsequently incorporated into the contract as a term. By this test, the buyer must be proactive to ensure that any statement made by the seller is treated with the utmost importance it deserves\n
    \n3. The third test is also propounded by Cheshire and Fifoot as a supportive test. This test posits that the buyer should make it known to the seller that he is relying on the statement he has made in entering the contract in question. This test is based on the requirement of “notice”. In other words, put the seller on notice that you are relying on his skill and judgment as evidence in the terms of the contract.\n
    \n4. The fourth test is propounded by another leading author on Law of Contract, Treitel. His test focuses on the opportunity of verification of the statement made by the seller or the buyer. In other words, did the buyer have the opportunity of confirming what the seller said, did the buyer avail himself of that opportunity? By the tenure of this test, if the buyer has the opportunity of confirming the seller‟s statement, but fails, neglects, omits or refuses to so confirm the statement, then the statement will be treated as a mere representation\n
    \n5.	The final test by Treitel focuses on the degree of importance that the parties collectively attach to the statement in question\n
    \nIt has been agreed that in determining whether a statement is a term of a contract or a mere representation, the knowledge, skill and expertise of the person making the statement is crucial. In other words, if a statement is made by a person who has special knowledge or skill in respect of the particular aspect of the transaction, then it would be regarded as term of the contract. On the other hand, if the statement was made by a person who had no knowledge or skill, it would be mere representation.See <i>Dick Bentely Production Ltd v. Harold Smith Motors, Oscar Chess Ltd v. Williams, D.P.M.S. Ltd v. Larmie [2000] 5 NWLR (Pt. 655) 138 at 141 ratio 6</i>\n
    \nFor the purpose of clarity, four of these terms OF Contract shall be discussed hereunder. These are;\n
   \n 1. Condition\n
    \n2. Warranties\n
    \n 3. Inorminate/intermediate terms\n
    \n4. Fundamental terms\n
    \n<b>Condition</b>
    \nIt is a term of such vital importance which goes to the root of the transaction. A breach of which according to <i>section 11(1)(b)SGA</i> gives rise to a right to treat the contract as repudiated.\n
    \nWhether a term/stipulation in a contract of sale is a condition or a warranty depends, in each case, on the construction of the contract. In two situations, <i>section 11 of the Sales of Goods Act</i> compels the innocent party to treat a breach of condition as if it were as breach of warranty:\n
    \ni.	Where the contract is not severable and the buyer has accepted the goods or part thereof, he cannot rescind\n
    \n ii. Where property in specific goods has already passed to the buyer, he cannot rescind unless there is a term of the contract express or implied to that effect\n
    \nSee <i>Rank Xeros Ltd v. Centerx Nig Ltd [1995] 1 NWLR (Pt. 54) 703, Federal Government of Nigeria v. Zebra Engine Ltd [2002] 18 NWLR (Pt. 798) 162 at 171, ratio 10</i>\n
    \n<b>Warranties</b>
    \nBy the tenure of <i>section 62(1) SGA</i>, a warranty is expressly defined as an agreement with reference to goods which are the subject of a contract of sale, but collateral to the main purpose of such contract, the breach of which gives rise to a claim for damages, but not to a right to reject the goods and treat the contract as repudiated.\n
    \n<b>Innominate or intermediate terms</b>
   \nInnominate or intermediate term is somewhat in between a condition and a warranty. In other words, the term is neither a condition nor a warranty. It can be regarded as a hybrid between a condition and a warranty.\n
    \nA breach of terms within this category could lead either to damages or to repudiation depending on the gravity of the breach. In the nutshell, if the breach goes to the root of the contract to the point that the injured party is deprived of the whole benefit he was supposed to obtain from the contract, the remedy would be repudiation. On the other hand, if the effect of the breach is the direct opposite of the above, the remedy would be damages only.\n
    \nThe overall idea is to avoid predetermining the nature of the term breached until the breach occurs. This new wave of thinking came about at common law in the locus classicus case of <i>Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co. v. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (1962) 2 Q.B. 26; (1962) 1 ALL E.R. 474, otherwise called the Hong Kong Fir’s case</i> where the existence of an innominate term was first robustly analysed by the court of Appeal\n
    \n<b>Fundamental Terms</b>
    \nA fundamental breach is a breach of condition. This means that there is a line of distinction between a fundamental term and a condition. As a matter of fact, a condition is of inferior position to a fundamental term. According to Davlin, J., in the case of <i>Smeaton Hanscomb &amp; Company Ltd v. Sasson Setty Sons &amp; Company (1953) 1 W.L.R. 1468</i>, a fundamental term underlies the whole contract and where is it not complied with, it means that the outcome runs totally against what the parties contemplated as forming the basis of the foundation of the contract. In short, where this happens, the contract is said to have failed\n
</string>
    <string name="implied">Implied Terms</string>
    <string name="implied1">In addition to express term of a contract which the courts are enjoined to enforce, parties may also be bound by terms which may not have been expressly stated by them but which are implied. The implied terms are\n
   \n<b>Terms implied by custom.</b>
    \nCourt are enjoined to enforce a contract term which can be deduced not from the express statement of the parties but by reason of the custom or tradition which has become acceptable as it concerns the particular transaction\n
   \nA term which may be implied on the basis of custom must not contradict the terms expressed by the parties. At best a term which is said to be custom or tradition of a transaction can only be implied in the absence of an express term. In <i>London Export Corporation v. Jubilee Coffee Roasting Company [1958] 2 All E.R. 41</i>, Lord Jenkins stated that an alleged custom can be incorporated into a contract only if there is nothing in the express or necessarily implied terms of the contract to prevent such inclusion.\n
   \nFurthermore, before a custom or tradition of a particular trade can be implied into a contract, it must not be contrary to a written law and it must be certain and reasonable. See <i>Re Walker [1904] 2 K.B. 152.</i>\n
    \n<b>Terms implied by statues</b>
    \nIn other to avoid injustice or confusion which may arise as a result of the absence of express terms, parliament from time to time make legislation which may have the effect or intention of implying certain terms into a contract even if they were not expressed by the parties or cannot be said to constitute the custom or tradition of the particular transaction.\n
    \nA typical example of this statutory or parliamentary intervention is the <i>Sale of Good Act of 1893</i>\n
   \nUnder this Act, all contracts for the sale of goods have certain terms implied into them notwithstanding that parties did not express them while concluding the contract. These terms are provided for in <i>Section 12, 13, 14 &amp; 15 of the Act.</i>\n
    \nThe implied terms under the sale of goods law include\n
   \n 1. The term of title and quiet possession – section 12 SGA\n
    \n2. The implied term of correspondence with contractual description – section 13 SGA\n
   \n3. The implied term of merchantable quality – section 14(2) SGA\n
   \n4. The implied term of suitability or fitness for purpose – section 14(1) SGA, and\n
    \n5. The implied term of correspondence with sample – section 15 SGA\n
   \nThese five terms are the traditional implied terms under the sale of goods law.\n
    \n<b>Implied terms as to title</b>
   \nThis is obviously one of the most important terms implied by law. Its importance is underscored by the fact that the fundamental basis of a sale contract is the transfer of property in the goods from the seller to the buyer. It is trite that title is the best evidence of ownership and therefore a transfer of valid title by the seller to the buyer becomes imperative in the circumstance. Therefore, the seller must transfer property or ownership in the goods to the buyer in order to fulfil his obligation under the contract. Where he fails to do this, it will be treated as a total failure of consideration.\n
    \n<i>Section 12(1) of the Sale of Good Act 1893</i> provides that “in a contract of sale, unless the circumstances of contract are such as to show a different intention, there is:\n
    \n 1. An implied condition on the part of the seller that in the case of a sale he has the right to sell the goods, and that in the case of an agreement to sell he will have a right to sell the goods at the time when the property is to pass.\n
   \n2. An implied warranty that the buyer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of the goods.\n
   \n 3. An implied warranty that the goods shall be free from any charge or encumbrance in favour of any third party, not declared or known to the buyer before or at the time when the contract is made”.\n
    \n<b>Condition as to right to sell</b>
    \n<i> Section 12(1) of the Sale of Good Act 1893</i> provides that “in a contract of sale, unless the circumstances of contract are such as to show a different intention, there is an implied condition on the part of the seller that in the case of a sale he has the right to sell the goods, and that in the case of an agreement to sell he will have a right to sell the goods at the time when the property is to pass. The above section contemplates both a sale and an agreement to sell. Accordingly the duty of the seller varies depending on whether it is a sale contract or an agreement to sell. In other words, the degree of responsibility placed on the seller by this implied term depends on the category of sale contract involved.\n
   \n<b>Warranty as to quiet possession</b>
    \n Section 12(2) SGA provides that “in a contract of sale, unless the circumstances of contract are such as to show a different intention, there is an implied warranty that the buyer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of the goods.” Two problems appear to have been encountered in the interpretation and application of this provision. The one relates to its scope, the other relates to the application of section 12(1). As regard its scope, the question is whether the provision admits any limitation or not, and the question in relation to the application of section 12(1) concerns the meaning of the term “right to sell”\n
   \nThe general principle is that apart from the obligation of putting the purchaser in possession, the owner must ensure that he remains in peaceful and undisturbed possession. Interference from an interested third party would constitute a disturbance. The implied warranty as to right to sell will also be broken if the goods cannot be sold without a trade mark\n
    \n<b>Warranty as to freedom from charge or encumbrance</b>
   \n<i>Section 12(3) SGA</i> provides that “in a contract of sale, unless the circumstances of contract are such as to show a different intention, there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be free from any charge or encumbrance in favour of any third party, not declared or known to the buyer before or at the time when the contract is made."\n
    \nIt is important to mention that the operative time for the existence of such charge or encumbrance is at the time the contract was made and the condition would not apply if the charge or encumbrance was known to the buyer or disclose to him at the time of sale.<i>Udekwu v. Abosi</i>\n
    \n<b>Implied terms as to correspondence with contractual description and sample</b>
    \n The implied term of correspondence with contractual description is unique because it is based on the pre-contract statements made by the seller.\n
   \n<i>Section 13 SGA</i> provides that “where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the goods must correspond with the description, and if the sale be by sample, as well as by description, it is not sufficient that the bulk of the goods corresponds with the sample, if the goods do not also correspond with the description”.\n
    \nUsually, this condition applies where the buyer has not seen the goods and relies on the seller‟s description. Under this condition where goods are sold by description, it must answer to the description.See <i>Varley v Whipp</i>\n
    \n<b>Implied terms as to sample</b>
    \nAccordingly, where goods are sold by sample and the buyer relies on the sample shown to him by the seller in making his order for the supply of the bulk, the law requires that the bulk supply must correspond with some measure of exactitude with the sample shown to him.\n
    \nSection 15 SGA provides that:\n
    \n (1) A contract of sale is a contract for sale by sample where there is a term in the contract, express or implied, to that effect,\n
   \n(2) In the case of contract for sale by sample\n
    \na. There is an implied condition that the bulk shall correspond with the sample in quality;\n
    \nb. There is an implied condition that the buyer shall have a reasonable opportunity of comparing the bulk with the sample;\n
    \n c. There is an implied condition that the goods shall be free from any defect rendering them unmerchantable which would not be apparent on reasonable examination of the sample\n
    \n<b>Implied terms as to merchantable quality</b>
   \nBy the provision of section 14(2) SGA “goods bought by description from a seller who deals in those goods (whether he be the manufacturer or not) must be of merchantable quality”. Merchantable quality here means that the goods are fit for any purpose for which the goods are normally used. The condition however does not apply where the buyer has examined the goods and failed to detect defects which such an examination ought to have revealed.See <i>NBC v. Okeojiminor</i>.\n
   \n<b>Nature and Scope of the Implied Term of Merchantable Quality</b>
    \nThe implied term of merchantable quality is beset with some complications: 1. The true nature and scope of this implied term and the other is ... 2. The enforceability of the implied term with respect to the meaning of this implied term. It is important to determine whether merchantable quality in the true sense of it means goods that are sellable or goods that are consumable or better still goods that are of satisfactory quality to the buyer.\n
    \n<b>Durability</b>
   \nGoods once supplied by the seller and accepted by the buyer should be merchantable for a reasonable time. What is reasonable would depend on the nature of the goods in question and the nature of the contract under which the goods were supplied\n
    \nThe problem of definition arises from the presumption that no goods can be adjudged to be totally useless. However before the court resolved that goods were merchantable if they were satisfactory to the buyer, some scholars as well as judicial tests have been fashioned to describe, define or ascertain when goods are merchantable. In fact some of these tests have been named after the judges who gave such decisions.\n
   \n1.	Lord Farewell LJ Test: <i>Bristol Tramways Company Ltd v. Fiat Motors Ltd (1910) 2 KB 381 at 418</i>. This test posits that goods are merchantable if a reasonable man acting reasonably after full examination would accept the goods in performance of the contract. Lord Farewell‟s test proved the burden on the buyer to carry out a comprehensive inspection and examination on the goods before accepting them under the contract. The buyer‟s right of examination is contingent on his knowledge of the goods in question.\n
   \n2.	Lord Dickson’s Test: this test was propounded in <i>Grant v. Australian Knitting Mill Ltd (1936) A.C. 85</i>. According to this test, goods are merchantable when the buyer fully acquainted with the facts surrounding the goods and knowing that the goods could have hidden defects but chooses to buy the goods because of the reduction in price. This is also called the “price test.”\n
    \n3.	Lord Wright Test: this test was propounded by Lord Wright in the case of Carmell Laird Company Ltd v. Managaness Bronze and Brass Ltd (1934) A.C. 402 at 430. According to this test, goods are merchantable if in the form in which they were tendered they were not of any use for the purpose the buyer desires them but are of use for any other purpose. This test underscores the fact that goods can be used for several purposes\n
    \n<b>Implied terms as to quality or fitness for purpose</b>
   \n<i> Section 14(1) SGA</i> provides thus: “Where the buyer expressly or by implication makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required so as to show that the buyer relies on the seller‟s skill or judgment and the goods are of a description which it is in the course of the seller‟s business to supply (whether he be the manufacturer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose provided that in the case of a contract for the sale of a specific article under its patent or other trade name, there is no implied condition as to its fitness for any particular purpose.\n
   \nHowever, this implied term is subject to some pre-conditions. These preconditions include:\n
   \n1. The seller must be a dealer of goods of that contractual description. In this context, it does not matter how long the seller has been in that business. Once he puts himself out, he is deemed to be a dealer of that product.\n
    \n 2. The buyer must have expressly or impliedly make known to the seller the particular purpose for which he requires the goods.\n
   \n3. The buyer must show that he relies on the seller‟s skill or judgment in his choice of the goods in question\n
    \n4. The goods in question must not be bought under a trademark, trade name or brand description.

    <string name="transfer">Transfer of Property of Goods</string>
    <string name="transfer1"><b>Introduction</b>
    \nThe primary object of a contract of sale under <i>section 1(1) SGA</i> is the transfer of property in the goods from the seller to the buyer. The seller either transfers or agrees to transfer such property by his contract or under it.\n
    \n<b>Property</b>
    \n Property within the contemplation of a sale contract means ownership. As a matter of fact, <i>section 62 SGA</i> declares that the term property as used in the Act means the general property and not merely a special property in the goods. General property essentially refers to the absolute legal interest or ownership in the goods in question\n
   \n<b>Transfer</b>
    \n Transfer as used in the Sale of Goods Act means symbolic delivery of title or ownership in the goods by the seller to the buyer. It is distinguished from delivery because delivery is the transfer of possession and not necessarily ownership.\n
    \nUnder <i>section 5(1) SGA</i>, goods are broadly classified into two categories, viz; future goods and existing goods. Existing goods are further classified into specific goods, unascertained goods, and ascertained goods.\n
    \n<b>Transfer of property in future goods</b>
    \n Future goods are those goods which are to be manufactured or acquire by the seller at the time the contract is concluded. Future goods are the direct opposite of existing goods. Existing goods are those goods which are owned or possessed by the seller at the time the contract is concluded. A contract for the sale of future goods can only be an agreement to sell\n
   \n<i>Section 18, Rule 5 SGA</i> provides that where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description, and the goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer, however, subject to the intention of the parties. Appropriation was defined within this context in the case of <i>Marabita v. Imperial Ottomon Bank Ltd (1978) 3 Ex Ch 164 at 172</i> thus “under a contract of chattels not specific the property does not pass to a purchaser unless there is afterward appropriation of specific chattels to pass under the contract i.e. unless the parties agree to the specific chattel to which property is to be done in order to pass it.”\n
   \n<b>Transfer of property in unascertained goods</b>
    \nUnascertained goods are the opposite of ascertained goods. They are goods that are yet to be identified or agreed upon by the parties at the time the contract is concluded. When unascertained goods are duly appropriated to the contract, they become ascertained\n
    \nBy virtue of <i>section 16 SGA</i>, where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained goods, no property in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until the goods are ascertained.”\n
    \nIn<i> Ajayi v. Eburu (1964) MWLR 41</i>, Obaseki J observed that unascertained goods are goods defined by description only or goods not yet in existence which the seller has himself to buy or manufacture.\n
    \n<b>Transfer of property in specific goods</b>
    \n<i> Section 61 SGA</i> defines specific goods as goods that have been identified and agreed upon by the parties at the time the contract is concluded. Once the goods in question are specific goods, the presumption is that property passes immediately subject however to the rules governing such transfer.\n
    \nIn <i>Howell v Coupland (1876) 1 Q.B. 258</i>, the court held that a contract for the sale of 200 tons of potatoes to be grown on a particular piece of land was a contract for the sale of specific goods. It is arguable that this case was not decided on the sale of goods law, rather on common law rule. It predates Sale of Goods Act of 1893. Consequently, it cannot be an authority in sale of goods law\n
    \n<b>Rules for ascertaining intention</b>
    \n<i> Section 18 of the Act</i> provides thus: “Unless a different intention appears, the following are rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass to the buyer.” This section contains five rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass to the buyer.\n
   \nRule 1 – Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment or the time of delivery, or both, be postponed\n
    \nRule 2 – Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods and the seller is bound to do something to the goods, for the purpose of putting them into a deliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing be done, and the buyer has notice thereof\n
    \nRule 3 – Where there is n unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh, measure, test, or do some other act or thing with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the property does not pass until such act or thing be done, and the buyer has notice thereof.\n
   \nRule 4 – Where the goods are delivered to the buyer on approval or “on sale or return” or other similar term the property therein passes to the buyer:\n
   \na.	When he signifies his approval of acceptance to the seller or does any other act adopting the transaction.\n
   \nb.	If he does not signify his approval or acceptance to the seller but retain the goods without giving notice of rejection then, if a time has been fixed for the return of the goods. On the expiration of the time fixed for the return, or on the expiration of a reasonable time, if no time has been fixed for the return. What is a reasonable time is a question of fact.\n
   \nRule 5 – (1). Where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description, and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer, or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer. Such assent may be express or implied, and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made.\n
    \nRule 5 – (2). Where in pursuance of the contract, the seller delivers the goods to the buyer or to a carrier or other bailee or custodier (whether named by the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, or does not reserve the right of disposal, he is deemed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to the contract.\n
   \n<b>Passing of Risk</b>
   \n<i> Section 20 of the Sales of Goods Act</i> provides thus: “Unless otherwise agreed, the goods remain at the seller‟s risk until the property therein is transferred to the buyer, but when the property therein is transferred to the buyer, the goods are at the buyer‟s risk whether delivery has been made or not. See <i>Demby Hamilton and Co. Ltd. v. Barden (1949) 1 All E.R. 435.</i>\n
    \n<b>The effect of rigid classification of goods on the utility of the transfer</b>
    \n Due to the fundamental nature of the transfer of property in the goods in a sale contract, it is important to know at what moment property passes in a contract of sale for the following reasons:\n
   \n1.	Risk generally passes with property; consequently, if the goods are damaged or stolen, the loss would normally fall on the owner by virtue of section 20 of the SGA. This is known as the principle of res perit domino\n
   \n2.	If property has passed, the seller may sue the buyer for the price by virtue of the provision of section 49 of the SGA\n
   \n3.	If the contract is for specific goods and the property has passed to the buyer, he cannot reject the goods for breach of condition but can only sue for damages by virtue of the provision of section 11(1)(c) SGA\n
    \n4.	Where property has not passed to the buyer, there would be no legal right for which any equitable remedy can lie against the buyer\n
    \nIn conclusion, the transfer of ownership or property in the goods in a sale contract points out the fundamental basis of a sale contract. Consequently, the point in time at which property passes from the seller to the buyer in a contract of sale depends on the category or classification of the goods.

    <string name="perform">Performance of Contract of Sale</string>
    <string name="perform1"><b>Introduction</b>
    \nA contract is defined as an agreement which the law will enforce or recognise as affecting the legal rights and duties of the parties\n
    \nOnce agreement with respect to goods has occurred between two or more persons for the purpose of business, they both have duties to fulfil as buyer and seller of such good. Failure by either party to perform will amount to a breach of the contract. For the purpose of this study, the parties to a contract of sale are the seller and the buyer, and each of these parties has their respective duties to perform under the contract.\n
    \n<b>Duties of Seller</b>
    \n The following are the duties of the seller to the buyer:\n
    \n 1. The duty to pass a good title – <i>section 12(1) SGA</i>\n
    \n2. The duty on the seller to deliver the goods – <i>section 27 SGA</i>\n
   \n<b>The duty to pass a good title</b>
   \n<i> Section 12(1) SGA</i> provides that “in a contract of sale, unless the circumstances of contract are such as to show a different intention, there is:\n
    \n1.	An implied condition on the part of the seller that in the case of a sale he has the right to sell the goods, and that in the case of an agreement to sell he will have a right to sell the goods at the time when the property is to pass\n
   \n2.	 An implied warranty that the buyer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of the goods\n
   \n3.	  An implied warranty that the goods shall be free from any charge or encumbrance in favour of any third party, not declared or known to the buyer before or at the time when the contract is made”\n
    \n<b>The duty on the seller to deliver the goods</b>
    \nThis duty is wide and expansive. Under <i>Section 27 SGA</i>, it is the duty of the seller to deliver the goods, and of the buyer to accept and pay for them, in accordance with the terms of the contract of sale. This section tells us that the seller has one duty on this core (regard) – to deliver the goods as agreed. The section also tells us that the buyer has two duties - to accept the goods and to pay for them\n
    \n<b>Payment and delivery are concurrent conditions</b>
    \n Under Section 28 SGA, it is established that unless otherwise agreed, delivery of the goods and payment of the price are concurrent conditions. This means that the seller must be ready and willing to give possession to the buyer in exchange for the price, and the buyer must be ready and willing to pay the price in exchange for possession of the goods. This rule found judicial application in the case of <i>J.B. Bekederemo v. Colgate Palmolive (Nig) Ltd (1976) 6 S.C. 15</i>\n
   \n<b>Meaning of delivery</b>
    \n<i> Section 62 SGA</i> defines delivery as a voluntary transfer of possession from one person to another. Note that the rules governing delivery are essentially a matter of agreement between the parties; and the rules contained in the Act only apply in so far as no contrary agreement has been made.\n
   \n<b>Method of Delivery</b>
    \nGenerally, there are six methods in which delivery can take place;\n
    \n1.	Direct physical transfer of goods to the buyer: It is the physical transfer of the goods themselves to the buyer or to his or her duly accredited agent or representative. The act of parting with possession by the seller to the buyer is direct in this regard.\n
   \n2.	Symbolic delivery: here the seller may transfer possession of the goods to the buyer by handing over to him the means of control over the goods, the subject matter of the contract, like a key to the seller‟s warehouse. This method of delivery was affirmed in the case of <i>Hilton v. Tucker (1888) 39 Ch. 699.</i>\n
    \n3.	Constructive delivery: under this method, the buyer is already in possession of the goods at the time of sale. But once the sale is effected, the character of the possession changes from possession as a bailee to possession as a buyer\n
    \n4.	By attornment: this occurs where the goods, the subject of the contract, are in possession of a third party.<i> Section 29(3) SGA</i> provides thus: “Where the goods at the time of sale are in possession of the third party, there is no delivery by the seller to the buyer unless and until such third party acknowledges to the buyer that he holds the goods on his behalf. Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the operation of the issue or transfer of any document of title to the goods”. This acknowledgment is called attornment and it is of special importance where the goods are in custody of warehousemen\n
   \n5.	By delivering document of title: the goods may be delivered by the delivery of document of titles to the buyer. See <i>section 2(1) of the Factor Act 1889</i>. The peculiar feature of document of title is that the mere transfer or endorsement of the document if accompanied by necessary intention would suffice to transfer the possession and the property in the goods even without attornment.\n
    \n6.	Delivery of goods to the buyer’s agent: delivery of the goods to the buyer‟s agent transfers possession to the buyer himself. Note that delivery to a carrier is prima facie delivery to the buyer. <i>Section 32 SGA</i> provides thus: “Where in pursuance of a contract of sale, the seller is authorized or required to send the goods to the buyer, delivery of the goods to carrier, whether named by the buyer or not, for the purpose of transmission to the buyer is prima facie deemed to be a delivery of the goods to the buyer”.\n
   \n<b>Place of Delivery</b>
    \n<i>Section 29(1) SGA</i> provides: “Whether it is for the buyer to take possession of the goods or for the seller to send them to the buyer is a question depending in each case on the contract, express or implied, between the parties. Apart from any such contract, express or implied, the place of delivery is the seller‟s place of business, if he has one, and if not, his residence: Provided that if the contract be for the sale of specific goods, which to the knowledge of the parties when the contract is made are in some other place, then that place is the place of delivery.”\n
    \n<b>Time of Delivery</b>
   \nBy virtue of <i>section 29(2) SGA</i>, where under a contract of sale the seller is bound to send the goods to the buyer where no time is fixed for sending the said goods, the seller is bound to send them within a reasonable time. In <i>Bowes v. Shan (1877) 2 A.C. 455 at 462</i>, the House of Lords held that the buyer could reject delivery when, instead of the seller delivering the goods (8200 bags of rice) in March 24th, delivered 8150 in February (not a little too early or late. It must be on time).\n
    \n<b>Delivery by instalments</b>
   \n<i> Section 31(1) SGA</i> provides “Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer of goods is not bound to accept delivery thereof by instalments”. <i>Section 11(1)(c) SGA</i> provides that where a contract of sale is not severable, and the buyer has accepted the goods, or part thereof, the breach of any condition to be fulfilled by the seller can only be treated as a breach of warranty, and not as a ground for rejecting the goods and treating the contract as repudiated, unless there be a term of the contract, express or implied, to that effect.\n
   \n<b>Delivery to a Carrier</b>
   \n If the seller is authorized or required to send the goods to the buyer, delivery to a carrier is prima facie delivery to the buyer whether named by him (the buyer) or not. <i>Section 32 (1) SGA</i> provides thus: “Where in pursuance of a contract of sale, the seller is authorized or required to send the goods to the buyer, delivery of the goods to carrier, whether named by the buyer or not, for the purpose of transmission to the buyer is prima facie deemed to be a delivery of the goods to the buyer”.\n
    \n<b>Contract of Carriage</b>
    \n<i> Section 32(2) SGA</i> provides thus: “Unless otherwise authorized by the buyer, the seller must make such contract with the carrier on behalf of the buyer as may be reasonable having regards to the nature of the goods and other circumstances of the case, and if the seller omits, so to do, and the goods are lost or damaged in the course of transit, the buyer may decline to treat the delivery to the carrier as delivery to himself or may hold the seller responsible in damages
</string>
    <string name="exam">Examination and Acceptance of Goods</string>
    <string name="exam1"><b>Buyer’s right of examination</b>
    \n<i> Section 34(1) SGA</i> provides that where goods are delivered to the buyer which he had not previously examined, he is not deemed to have accepted unless and until he has had a reasonable opportunity of examining them for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in conformity with the contract.\n
   \n<b>Acceptance of Goods</b>
    \nIt is instructive to mention that section 34 SGA must be read side by side with section 35 SGA which says that the buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods when he intimates to the seller that he has accepted them, or when the good have been delivered to him and he does any act in relation to them which is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller‟s, or when after the lapse of a reasonable time he retains the goods without intimating the seller that he rejected them. <i>Reuben v. Faire Brothers &amp; Co. Ltd (1949) 1 K.B. 254</i>\n
\nThe general rule is that the buyer is entitled to the delivery of all the goods at the same time. See section 30 SGA provides that where the seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods less than he contracted to sell, the buyer may reject them, but if the buyer accepts the goods so delivered, he must pay for them at the contract rate\n
    \nIt is apposite to mention that the seller cannot excuse the short delivery on the ground that he would deliver the remainder in due course. <i>Section 31(1) SGA</i> has this to say “Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer of goods is not bound to accept delivery thereof by instalments.\n
    \n<b>The de minimis rule</b>
    \nIf the seller delivers goods which fail by a slight margin to conform to the description or if he delivers in fraction too much or too little, the buyer may reject the whole of the delivery. The qualification of this is that if the deviations are microscopic or negligible, the seller may be able to plead the de minimis rule. . But the de minimis rule has a limited scope and is somewhat random or ambivalent in its application. the de minimis rule was held to apply in the case of <i>Shipton Anderson Co Ltd v. Weil Brothers &amp; Co Ltd (1912) 1 Q.B. 576.</i>
</string>
    <string name="duties">Duties of the Buyer</string>
    <string name="duties1">There are two basic duties imposed on the buyer as established earliest in time. <i>Section 27 SGA</i> provides an answer to one – <b>the duty to pay the price</b>. The section provides that it the duty of the seller to deliver the goods, and of the buyer to accept and pay for them, in accordance with the terms of the contract.\n
    \nIt is pertinent to mention that damages would be obtained for late payment of the price and interest may be awarded to the seller by the court where the seller has been kept out of his money. See <i>Decro Wall International S.A. v. Practitioners in Marketing Ltd (1971) 1 WLR 361.</i>\n
    \nThe second duty of the buyer is <b>the duty to take delivery</b>. It is the duty of the buyer to take delivery of the goods at the seller‟s place of business or his residence or any other place agreed upon in the contract.\n
    \nUnder <i>Section 28 SGA</i>, it is provided that unless otherwise agreed, delivery of the goods and payment of the price are concurrent conditions. This means that the seller must be ready and willing to give possession to the buyer in exchange for the price, and the buyer must be ready and willing to pay the price in exchange for possession of the goods.\n
   \n<b>REMEDIES</b>
    \nIn this context, remedies would be seen as the options or right available to parties to a contract of sale in the event of breach.\n
   \n<b>Remedies of the Seller</b>
    \nThe remedies of the seller who is unpaid (i.e. unpaid seller) can be classified into two, viz;\n
   \n 1. Real remedies, and\n
   \n2. Personal remedies\n
    \n<b>Real remedies – rights in rem</b>
    \nThe real remedies of unpaid seller are remedies against the goods themselves. They include;\n
   \na. Right of a lien – sections 41-43 of the SGA\n
    \n b. Right of stoppage in transitu – sections 44-46\n
   \nc. Right of retention of the goods coextensive with the right of a lien and of stoppage in transitu – <i>section 39(2) SGA</i>\n
    \nd. Right of resale – section 48 SGA\n
    \n<b>Personal remedies – rights in personam</b>
   \nThe personal remedies of a seller include\n
   \na. Right to sue for the price – section 49 SGA, and\n
   \n b. Action for damages for non-acceptance of delivery\n
    \nWho is an unpaid seller? By virtue of <i>Section 38(1) of the Sales of Goods Act</i> the seller of goods is deemed to be an “unpaid seller”\n
   \n(a) When the whole of the price has not been paid or tendered;\n
    \n(b) When a bill of exchange or other negotiable instrument has been received as conditional payment and the condition on which it was received has not been fulfilled by reason of dishonour of the instrument or otherwise.\n
   \n<b>Lien</b>
   \nAn unpaid seller‟s lien is a right to retain the goods until full payment has been made or tendered by or on behalf of the buyer. It is an equitable lien primarily designed to afford protection to the unpaid seller so long as the buyer or his agent has not acquire actual possession of the goods\n
    \n<b>Definition of a lien</b>
   \nNowhere in the statute is the concept lien defined, but we can call in judicial aid. In <i>Harmon v. Berkley (1802) 2 East 227</i>, a lien was defined as follows; “A lien is the right of one man to retain that which is in his possession belonging to another till certain demands on him, the person in possession are satisfied”.\n
    \nWhen does a lien arise? There are three ways in which lien arise. In other words, the seller‟s lien arises if three conditions are satisfied;\n
   \n1.	The seller must be in possession for his right of lien to arise. The lien entitles the unpaid seller of goods to “retain possession” of them and not to “regain possession” of goods after he has given them up.\n
    \n2.	The seller must be an unpaid seller as defined by section 38 SGA. Therefore, the whole of the price must be paid before the buyer can be said to have discharge the lien.\n
    \n3.	The goods must have been sold without any stipulation as to credit, or the stipulated period of credit has expired, or the buyer has become insolvent. Where the term of the credit expires, he becomes entitle to it.\n
    \nIt is important to stress that the mere fact that a buyer becomes insolvent or even bankrupt does not rescind the contract or amount to a repudiation of it. Therefore the trustee in bankruptcy could tender the amount due to the seller and claim delivery of the goods\n
    \n<b>Termination of a Lien</b>
    \n By virtue of <i>section 43(1) SGA</i>, a lien is terminated in the circumstances provided for in this particular section. These circumstances include:\n
   \n a. When he delivers the goods to a carrier or other bailee or custodian for the purpose of transmission to the buyer without reserving the right of disposal of the goods;\n
    \nb. When the buyer or his agent lawfully obtains possession of the goods;\n
   \n c. By waiver thereof. Waiver arises where one party leads the other to believe that he will not insist on the precise stipulation in the contract\n
    \n<b>The right of stoppage in transitu</b>
    \nThe right of an unpaid seller to stop the goods in transitu (in transit) is provided for under section 44 SGA, particularly sections 44-46 SGA. The importance of this right is that it entitles the unpaid seller not only to interfere with goods which are with someone not his agent or his servant, but also with goods vested with some other person.\n
    \nThe unpaid seller can exercise his right of stoppage in transitu if the following conditions are satisfied;\n
    \n 1. The seller must be unpaid within the meaning of SGA\n
   \n2. The buyer must be insolvent\n
    \n3. The goods must be in the course of transit\n
    \nGoods are deemed to be in the course of transit from the time they are delivered to a carrier by land, by sea, by rail or other bailee or custodian for the purpose of transmission to the buyer until the buyer or his agent in that behalf takes delivery of them from such carrier or other bailee or custodian.\n
   \n<b>When does a transit end or abate?</b>
    \ni.	When the buyer or his agent lawfully obtains delivery of the goods: <i>Section 32(1) SGA</i> provides that delivery to a carrier is prima facie delivery to the buyer. However, this is only constructive delivery and not actual delivery. So when the buyer or his agent actually obtains delivery of the goods, the transit and stoppage are at an end because the buyer is now in possession. This provision was given judicial interpretation in the case of <i>Reddall v. Union Castle Mail Steamship Co Ltd (1914) 84 LJKB 360</i> where the buyer intercepted the goods at the end of one stage in their transit and the goods were in still in the custody of a carrier, it was held that transit had ended.\n
    \nii.	When acknowledgment by the carrier or other bailee or custodian to the buyer or his agent has taken place after the arrival of the goods. <i>Section 45(3) SGA</i> provides that if after the arrival of the goods at the appointed destination, the carrier or other bailee or custodian acknowledges to the buyer or his agent that he holds the goods on his behalf and then continues in possession of them as bailee or custodian for the buyer or his agent, the transit is at an end and it is immaterial that a further destination of the goods may have been indicated by the buyer.\n
    \niii.	<i>Section 45(6) SGA</i> provides that where the carrier or other bailee wrongfully refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer or his agent in that behalf, a transit is deemed to be at an end\n
    \n<b>Right of Retention</b>
    \n<i> Section 39 SGA</i> grants the unpaid seller‟s right to withhold delivery of the goods where the property in the goods has not passed to the buyer. This right is similar and coextensive with the seller‟s right of lien and of stoppage in transitu when the property has passed to the buyer\n
    \n<b>Right of Resale</b>
   \nThe unpaid seller‟s right of lien, stoppage in transitu and retention are frequently exercised with a view to ultimate resale of the goods. <i>Section 48 SGA</i> deals with the right of the second buyer and the position as between the seller and the original buyer (the initial buyer). Where the unpaid seller executes his right of resale under this section, the second buyer acquires a good title to the goods as against the original buyer in the following circumstances\n
   \ni.	If the seller is still the owner of the goods at the time of resale, that is, property has not passed to the buyer for reason that he may not have paid the price on requirement\n
    \nii.	Under section 48(2) SGA, after an unpaid seller has exercise his right of lien or stoppage in transitu and then resells, the second buyer acquires good title. The second buyer here is protected even if the seller‟s resale is wrongful as against the original buyer.\n
    \niii.	Where the goods are of perishable nature, a notice of resale to the original buyer is not necessary. On the other hand, where the goods are not perishable goods, the seller is duty bound to give notice to the original buyer of his intention to resell and would incur no liability where the original buyer does not within a reasonable time pay or tender the price\n
   \niv.	 Where the unpaid seller resells as mercantile agent, the second buyer acquires good title.\n
   \n<b>Seller’s Personal Remedy - Action against the Buyer</b>
   \ni.	Action for the price: by virtue of <i>section 49 SGA</i>, where the property or ownership in the goods has passed to the buyer or where specific date of payment was set and has passed, the seller can sue for the contract price.\n
   \nii.	Action for damages for non-acceptance: <i>section 50 SGA</i> provides that where the buyer refuses to accept delivery or pay for the goods, the seller may claim damages, the measure being “the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of event from the buyer‟s breach of contract”.\n
    \niii.	Damages following resale:<i> Section 48(3) SGA</i> provides that where the goods are of perishable nature, or where the unpaid seller gives notice to the buyer of his intention to resell and the buyer does not within a reasonable time pay or tender the price, the unpaid seller may re-sell the goods and recover from the original buyer damages for any loss occasioned by his breach of contract.\n
   \niv.	Special damages: <i>section 54 SGA</i> provides thus: “Nothing in this Act shall affect the right of ...or the seller to recover interest or special damages in any case where by law interest or special damages may be recoverable...”\n
    \n<b>Buyer’s Remedy - Action by the Buyer</b>
   \nThe buyer‟s remedies against the seller include the following\n
    \n 1. Right to reject defective goods.\n
    \n 2. Right to recover the price.\n
    \n3. Action for damages for breach of warranty or condition.See <i>Section 53 SGA</i>\n
    \n4. Action for damages for non-delivery or delayed delivery: the buyer can sue for damages for non-delivery where the seller neglects or refuses to deliver the goods. See section 51 SGA\n
    \n5. Action for specific performance: section 52 SGA. The court may order specific performance of the contract, compelling the seller to deliver the goods he has sold. This remedy is discretionary and will only be granted where damages would not be an adequate remedy, or where the goods are rare.\n
    \n6. Action for money had and received.\n
   \n7. Action in tort for detinue or conversion.\n
   \n8. Special damages: <i>section 54 SGA</i> provides thus: “Nothing in this Act shall affect the right of the buyer ...to recover interest or special damages in any case where by law interest or special damages may be recoverable...”

    <string name="hire">Hire Purchase</string>
    <string name="hire1">There are judicial definitions which have suggested definitions of the term. In Halsbury’s Laws of England Vol. 1st Edition, a contract of hire purchase has been defined as “a contract of hire with option to purchase under which the owner of the chattel undertakes to sell it to, or that it shall become the property of the hirer conditionally on his making a certain number of payments.\n
   \nA statutory definition is encapsulated in <i>Section 20 of the Hire Purchase Act of 1965</i> (hereinafter refer to as HPA). Under this statute, Hire Purchase is defined as “bailment of goods in pursuance of an agreement under which the bailee may buy the goods or under which property in the goods will or may pass to the bailee.”\n
    \n<b>Clarification of Concepts</b>
   \nFrom the above statutory definition, the following key words can be extracted.\n
   \n1.	Bailment: a bailment contract is a contract whereby a party called a bailor gives out the custody or the possession of his goods to another party called the bailee for safe keeping, maintenance or otherwise, and on the condition that the bailee will return the goods on demand. A bailment contract could be gratuitous or for an agreed money consideration (that is, a fee). In <i>Coggs v. Bernard (1703) 92 E.R. 108</i>, Holt, CJ, essentially classified bailment into two, either gratuitous or contractual, i.e. for good consideration\n
   \n2.	 Property: this means the general property in the goods and not merely a special property. Property in this context means ownership as distinct from possessory right.\n
    \n3.	Transfer: this is the purchase itself.\n
    \n4.	May or may not: this means that purchase is not mandatory. The bailee has an option to either buy the goods at the end of the hire period and after all payments have been made or choose to return the goods at any time and stop paying for the hire provided he is not in arrears of payments\n
   \nIt is imperative to mention that hire purchase is not the same thing as credit as many had misconstrued it to be. The difference between these two types of transactions was demystified in the case of <i>Ajaegbe v. Idowu (2011) LPELR – SC 271</i>, where the Supreme Court made a distinction between a hire purchase and a credit sale. The court held thus: "The difference between an outright sale and a Hire Purchase agreement is that in the former, the property in the vehicle passes to the purchaser as soon as the contract is entered into, whereas in the latter, the property in the vehicle still remain vested in the owner until payment is fully made.\n
    \n<b>EVOLUTION OF HIRE PURCHASE</b>
    \nThe origin of modern Hire Purchase agreement is the Mid-Victorian custom in furniture trade under which persons who were unable to pay for the furniture at the time they desired to purchase it or who were not sufficiently worthy of open credit were allowed to take them and liquidate the payment through installments\n
    \nThe Factors Act of 1889 and the Sale of Goods Act of 1893 of England contained some provisions which legalized this arrangement. As a matter of fact, the Hire Purchase Act did not come to being until the Factors Act, 1889 and Sale of Good Act 1893 which contain overlapping provisions that enable a person who has bought or agreed to buy or who is in possession of goods or document of title of goods with the consent of the owner, to pass a valid title to a third party (bona fide purchaser for value) who bought without notice of the right of the original owner\n
   \nIt thus follows that while the owner needed protection from the law against the hirer who would in the middle of the transaction and without fulfilling his obligation of the instalmental payment either sell or pledge the goods to an innocent third party, the hirer on the other hand needed protection from the law against an owner who would indiscriminately exercise his ownership rights by repossessing the goods even when the hirer has made reasonable instalmental payments.\n
    \nIn Nigeria as well, the contract of hire purchase is also of recent origin. Indeed, the first Act passed on this matter was in 1965. Its practice however dates back to scores of years ago when local traders sold on credit.\n
   \n<b>Features of Hire Purchase</b>
    \n While the celebrated case of Helby v. Matthew heralded the birth of Hire Purchase at common law, it was not too long thereafter that it became apparent that the principles governing Hire Purchase at common law were not sufficient to fully address the issue pre-dating Helby v. Matthew. There was therefore the need to have a specialized statute properly articulating the interest of the parties especially the hirer. Hire Purchase according to Lord Herschell in Helby v. Matthew has the following features:\n
    \n 1. There is a letting and hiring of the goods to the hirer,\n
    \n2. The assumption of certain obligations by the hirer with respect of the custody, the care of the goods and the payment of the agreed installment,\n
   \n3. An option to return the goods at any time to the owner and thereby terminate the agreement, and\n
   \n4. An option to purchase the goods at the end of the hiring period subject to the meeting or fulfilment of the terms and conditions of the hire purchase agreement.
</string>
    <string name="distinhire">Hire Purchase Distinguished from Other Legal Transactons</string>
    <string name="distinhire1">The term hire purchase is always loosely employed by many people as synonymous with credit purchase or such similar transactions. Here the Hire Purchase transaction will be distinguished from other legal transactions.\n
    \n<b>Hire Purchase vs Sale</b>
   \nOne of the similarities between a sale contract and hire purchase is that both transactions involve the subject matter of goods. Another similarity is that in both transactions, the money consideration is called the price. The third, though debatable, is that in both transactions the parties contemplate or envisaged the transfer of property in the goods from the seller to the buyer. Thus the ultimate objective of a contract of hire purchase like that of a contract of sale is the transfer of property in the goods to the buyer in the case of a contract of sale, and to the hirer in the case of a contract of hire purchase.\n
   \nThe fundamental difference between a hire purchase transaction and a sale transaction is that in sale contract, the transfer of property in the goods from the seller to the buyer is imperative or mandatory upon the payment of the full price subject to all other variables. Whereas in a hire purchase contract the transfer of property in the goods is optional or conditional. As a matter of fact, in a hire purchase transaction the hirer does not acquire any title or ownership of the goods, albeit the he is in possession, unless and until he exercises his option to purchase.\n
    \nIn form, a contract of hire purchase is a bailment of goods by the owner (bailor) to the hirer (bailee) coupled with an option to the hirer to purchase the goods when all instalments have been paid\n
    \nAnother point of difference that can be drawn between a sale contract and a hire purchase is that the owner in a hire purchase contract has a statutory right to repossess the goods for failure by the hirer to pay the due installments, but no similar right accrues to the seller in a sale contract. This point was judicially affirmed in <i>Kasali Raimi v. Ogundara &amp; Ors [1986] 3 NWLR 97</i>,when the Supreme Court held that there are two principal rights of the owner of the goods under a hire  purchase contract, namely; (1) the right to the repossession of the goods upon breach of a term of the hire purchase agreement which exists until the hirer exercise his right of option, and (2) the owner‟s right to the hire rentals due under the hire purchase agreement for any period which the hirer in fact made use of the goods.\n
    \nAnother point of difference that can be drawn between a sale contract and a hire purchase is that a person who obtains good under a sale contract could not insist on returning them and so absolves himself from the obligation to pay the price unless he was exercising his statutory right of rejection.\n
    \nThis point was given judicial approval in the case of <i>Joe Allen Co. Ltd v. Sani Adewale &amp; Anor</i>, where Kingdom, CJ., emphasised the distinction when he stated: “The test to be applied is whether or not the party receiving the goods has the legal right to return them at his own option and thereupon to cease paying instalment, if he has, the agreement is an agreement to hire, with possibly an option to the hirer to purchase. If he has not, the agreement is an agreement to sell”\n
    \n<b>Hire Purchase vs. Conditional Sale</b>
   \n The distinction between hire purchase and conditional sale is difficult to draw because both transactions are premised on condition precedent. These condition precedents must be fulfilled before there can be transfer of ownership in the goods to the buyer or the hirer as the case may be.\n
   \nBoth transactions are different because a conditional sale remains an agreement to sell and therefore by virtue of section 2(1) of the Sale of Good Act of 1893 it remains a sale, whereas hire purchase agreement is a hybrid transaction that is outside the purview of the Sale of Goods law.See <i>Amao v. Ajibade &amp; Ors (1955-56) WRNLR 121</i>\n
    \n<b>Hire Purchase vs. Credit Sale</b>
    \n Credit sale is a situation where a person intends to make an outright purchase of goods but does not have sufficient money to make full payment for them.\n
   \nHire purchase and credit sale are similar transaction because they are both consumer credit transactions. Hire purchase Act covers credit sale on the condition that the instalmental payment is more than five times. The buyer or hirer is given the benefit of spreading the payment of the purchase price over an agreed period\n
    \nThe fundamental difference between a hire purchase transaction and a credit sale is that in a credit sale the property or ownership in the goods is transferred to the buyer immediately the agreement is concluded irrespective of the fact that he has not paid the total purchase price. However, where there is a condition precedent to be fulfilled, until such condition is fulfilled, ownership will not pass to the buyer. The sale then becomes a conditional sale.\n
   \nSimilarly, a seller in a credit sale cannot ordinarily repossess the goods after the contract has been concluded unless there is a stipulation to that effect, whereas an owner in a hire purchase transaction can repossess the goods.\n
    \n<b>Hire Purchase vs. Equipment Leasing</b>
    \nEquipment leasing is a form of transaction which entails the bailment of goods by the lessee for a given period and the hirer is expected to pay for the service by periodic payments.\n
   \nThere is however some similarities between both transactions. Firstly, both transactions involve the same subject matter, i.e. goods. Secondly, both transactions involve some form of bailment, i.e. hire of goods. Thirdly, both transactions involve the payment of periodic rent by the bailee or lessee as the case may be. Fourthly, both transactions envisage the retention of property in the goods by the owner or the lessor as the case may be, while the lessee or hirer is vested with possessory right.\n
    \nNotwithstanding these similarities, there are however some differences between these two transactions. Firstly, a lessee in an equipment leasing does not have the option to purchase the goods subject to the equipment lease, whereas a hirer in a hire purchase transaction has the option to purchase the goods. Secondly, a lessee in an equipment lease is under an obligation to pay for the wear and tears of the goods subject to the equipment lease, whereas a hirer in a hire purchase transaction is only liable to pay such when he breaches his covenant to maintain the goods. Thirdly, hire purchase transaction is now statutorily regulated or governed by the Hire Purchase Act, whereas equipment lease remains at the domain of common law. Put differently, equipment leasing like other type of transactions is governed by common law. Fourthly and most importantly, equipment leasing does not transfer title to the hirer or lessee. The lease only enables the lessee to use the goods for his immediate use nd doesn’t want to own the property\n
   \n<b>Hire Purchase vs. Chattel Mortgage</b>
    \nA chattel mortgage transaction involves the temporary giving up of the right of the mortgagor to the mortgagee. Mortgage is a kind of arrangement where one person who desire some finance borrows money from a person or a financial institution and uses his chattel as collateral for the loan.\n
   \n<b>FEATURES OF HIRE PURCHASE UNDER COMMON LAW</b>
    \nThe features of hire purchase under the common law can be regarded as the defects, challenges
or negative impacts of hire purchase under common law. Hire purchase under common law had
certain defects or imperfections that made it no longer attractive to hirers. These imperfections were
part of the inherent nature of hire purchase under common law. These imperfections are traceable to
the rigid and strict nature of common law\n
   \n Hire purchase at common law was inundated with a
plethora of onerous or uncautionable clauses (unfair terms). These onerous clauses took away the
hirer‟s freedom of contract and emasculated him to the whims and caprices of the owner. These
onerous clauses include the following;\n
    \n1. At common law, the hirer has no right to redeem the hire purchase goods if repossessed by the owner
due to his default. In other words, there was absence of the right of the hirer to redeem the hired
goods after default in instalmental payment\n
    \n2. At common law, if the hirer wrongfully (either ignorantly or deliberately) returns the goods to the
owner before the expiration of the hire period, the owner can recollect it and yet would insist that the
hirer pays for the unexpired period.\n
   \n3. The hire purchase agreement transfers no property or any special interest (apart from possssory
rights) to the hirer irrespective of the amount of instalment he had paid. He can only enjoy such right
when he has completed the payment of all instalments and exercise his option to purchase the goods.
   \n4. At common law, the hirer was subjected to the penalty of the “minimum payment” clause with
respect to the wear and tear of the goods if he terminates the contract and returns the goods. By the
concept of the minimum payment clause, the hirer was exposed to a double jeopardy ultimately
making him to pay money for service not rendered\n
   \n5. At common law, the owner‟s right to repossess the goods was unrestricted, unregulated and arbitrary.
Therefore, there were so many incidented (recorded) cases of abuses of the right of repossession by
the owner. The owner was not restricted as to the quantum of instalment payable by the hirer before
he can repossess. The owner was equally not restricted as to the procedure to be adopted in enforcing
his right to repossess the goods\n
    \n6. At common law, there was no requirement of formalism for the creation of Hire Purchase agreement.
In other words, writing was not a precondition for the validity and enforcement of hire purchase at
common law</string>
    <string name="hireact">Hire Purchase Under the Act</string>
    <string name="hireact1"><b>Scope of Hire Purchase Act</b></string>
    <string name="hireact2">The Hire purchase Act has limited scope. It is not an all-purpose vehicle. Rather, it is a special purpose vehicle. The Act has a subject matter limit as well as monetary limit in terms of its coverage. The monetary limit of the hire purchase as at its enactment is N2,000 in respect of goods other than motor vehicles. <i>Section 1 (a) of the Act</i> provides that the Act shall regulate all hire‐purchase agreements and credit‐sale agreements (other than agreements in respect of motor vehicles) under which the hire‐purchase price or total purchase price, as the case may be, does not exceed two thousand naira</string>
    <string name="hireact3">\n<b>Fundamental Objectives of the Hire Purchase Act</b></string>
    <string name="hireact4">The Hire Purchase Act as a statutory intervention has five basic or fundamental polices or objectives. They are:</string>
    <string name="hireact5">\n1.	The right to consumer information. This objective ensures that the hirer is given adequate information by the owner as regard the entirety of the contract itself. These information include the terms and conditions of the proposed hire purchased agreement as well as the nature and condition of the goods to be supplied under the agreement.</string>
    <string name="hireact6">\n2.	An abatement of the restriction of the hirer’s contractual freedom. The Hire Purchase Act prohibits the restriction of the hirer‟s contractual freedom through the use of such onerous and punitive clauses.</string>
    <string name="hireact7">\n3.	Absence of exclusion clauses. Under the Hire Purchase Act, it became impossible for the owner to insert exclusion clauses into the hire purchase agreement. This is because by virtue of <i>section 4 of the Act</i> the implied terms of title, merchantable quality and fitness for purpose became non-excludable.</string>
    <string name="hireact8">\n4.	The hirer’s right to terminate the contract. The Act permits the hirer to terminate the contract and return the goods to the owner without attracting further liability.</string>
    <string name="hireact9">\n5.	The introduction of formalism. The Hire Purchase Act introduces formalism into the creation and regulation of a hire purchase agreement. By the tenure of the provisions of the Act, a hire purchase agreement is elevated to the status of a quasi-standard form contract. This is because the Act introduces the formalism of writing as a precondition for the validity of hire purchase contract or agreement.</string>
    <string name="hireact10">\n<b>FORMALITIES FOR CREATING HIRE PURCHASE UNDER THE ACT</b></string>
    <string name="hireact11"> The formalities under the Hire Purchase Act are provided for under <i>section 2(1) (a) &amp; (b) of the Act</i>. These formalities addressed the core issues encapsulated by the Act. These issues include;</string>
    <string name="hireact12">\n1. Access to information, and</string>
    <string name="hireact13"> \n2. The need for proper documentation of the agreement</string>
    <string name="hireact14">\n<b>At the Preliminary Stage</b></string>
    <string name="hireact15"> Specifically, <i>section 2(1) of the Act</i> provides that a hire purchase agreement is only valid and enforceable if it satisfies the following conditions;</string>
    <string name="hireact16">\n1.	There must be a notice of the cash price of the goods proposed to be sold under the agreement as distinct from the hire purchase price</string>
    <string name="hireact17">\n2.	Hirer must be given opportunity of inspecting the goods proposed to be sold under the hire purchase agreement. The inspection can be done physically or through a catalogue or even online as it is in contemporary time. The rationale behind the inspection is to put the hirer on notice as to the physical state or condition of the goods proposed to “buy”</string>
    <string name="hireact18">\n3.	The owner should prepare a statement detailing the goods, if more than one, that is covered by the hire purchase agreement.</string>
    <string name="hireact19">\n<b>Documentation Stage</b></string>
    <string name="hireact20"> One of the fundamental requirements of the Hire Purchase Act is that all hire purchase agreement must be in writing. The requirement of writing makes the hire purchase agreement to fall into the category of contracts that are not enforceable if not reduced into writing</string>
    <string name="hireact21">\nApart from the insistence of writing, section 2(2) of the Act also prescribes the content of the written agreement.  The content of a standard hire purchase agreement under the Act include the following;</string>
    <string name="hireact22">\ni)	A statement of the hire‐purchase price of the goods to which the agreement relates,</string>
    <string name="hireact23">\nii)	 A statement of the cash price of the goods to which the agreement relates,</string>
    <string name="hireact24">\niii)	 A statement of the amount of each of the installments payable,</string>
    <string name="hireact25">\niv)	A statement of the date or the mode of determining the date of payment of each installment</string>
    <string name="hireact26">\nv)	A statement of the deposit payable or paid (as the case may be). This aspect is subject to negotiation by the parties. In other words, the parties are at liberty to negotiate how much should be paid at every installment</string>
    <string name="hireact27">\nvi)	 A statement of the true interest rate charged by the owner on the hire purchase agreement.</string>
    <string name="hireact28">\nvii)	 A list of the goods to which the agreement relates sufficient to identify them; and</string>
    <string name="hireact29">\nviii)	 A notice in the terms provided in the schedule to the Act informing the hirer of his right to terminate the contract.</string>
    <string name="hireact30">\n<b>Endorsement and attestation</b></string>
    <string name="hireact31">Endorsement is part of the execution of a hire purchase agreement through the signature of the respective parties. Attestation is the witnessing of the signature of the agreement by the respective parties</string>
    <string name="hireact32">\nExecution of the hire purchase agreement must be done in cognizance of the provisions of the Illiterate Protection Act. Accordingly, where an illiterate is a party, there must be an illiterate jurat endorsed in the document. Illiterate jurat is a form of confirmation that the illiterate read the content of the writer</string>
    <string name="hireact33">\nWhereas an owner in a hire purchase agreement can sign through an agent or nominee, a hirer cannot do so. In other words, a hirer must sign personally.</string>
    <string name="hireact35">\nEvery hire purchase agreement should be secured by a guarantor on behalf of the hirer. In other words, a typical hire purchase contract should be tripartite in nature (owner, hirer, and guarantor).</string>
    <string name="hireact36">\n<b>Effect of Non-compliance</b></string>
    <string name="hireact37">The effect of non-compliance with the provisions of the Hire Purchase Act as regard the formalities set out above can be viewed from the perspective of the three parties – that is, the owner, the guarantor and the hirer‟s perspective.</string>
    <string name="hireact38">\nOn the part of the owner, it is settled that agreement that is not in conformity with the provisions of the Hire Purchase Act is void ab initio to that extent, it is unenforceable by the court. In other words, the owner cannot enforce the agreement against the hirer or the guarantor. See <i>Savannah Bank Ltd v. Ajillo &amp; Ors [1989] 1 NWLR (Pt. 97) …; (1989) All N.L.R 26; (1989) 1 S.C. (Pt 11) 90.</i></string>
    <string name="hireact39">\nHowever, it should be noted that the incidence of non-compliance does not deprive the owner of his proprietary right over the goods subject to hire purchase agreement. In other words, the owner cannot enforce the terms and the obligation on the hire purchase agreement. The owner still retains his right of ownership especially where the hirer has not completed the payment of the hire purchase price before the issue of non-compliance arose.</string>
    <string name="hireact40">\nOn the part of the hirer, the agreement is voidable at his instance. The hirer has a choice whether to accept the contract with the defect inherent in it or to take step in avoiding it. Once the hirer has waived the defect in the hire purchase agreement, it becomes enforceable.</string>
    <string name="hireact41"> \nOn the part of the guarantor, the hire purchase agreement against him is not enforceable because his liability flows from the existence of a valid hire purchase agreement. Where there is none, he cannot be held liable either as a primary or secondary liability. See <i>Alhaji Kelani v. Balogun</i></string>
    <string name="hireact42">\n<b>The court discretion</b></string>
    <string name="hireact43"> It should be noted that in spite of the high stand of the court against the enforcement of the hire purchase agreement that are not in compliance with the provisions of the Act, the court still has a discretion to severe the hire purchase agreement that is not fundamentally defective and enforce same on behalf of the hirer. This it does when upon a review of the positions of the respective parties will come to the conclusion that is in the interest of justice, equity and fair play to enforce the otherwise defective contract.
</string>
    <string name="hiredyn">The Dynamics Of Hire Purchase Transaction</string>
    <string name="hiredyn1">There are different parties to hire purchase agreement in the real sense of it (i.e. in practice) apart from the hirer, owner and the guarantor. This is because the hire purchase agreement is a business stratagem/scheme often used by money lenders or finance companies to engage in money lending</string>
    <string name="hiredyn2">\nAccordingly, the following parties to the hire purchase agreement can be discerned;</string>
    <string name="hiredyn3">\n1. The finance company and the hirer</string>
    <string name="hiredyn4"> \n2. The finance company and the dealer/retailer</string>
    <string name="hiredyn5">\n3. The finance company and the guarantor</string>
    <string name="hiredyn6">\n4. The owner and the guarantor</string>
    <string name="hiredyn7">\n5. The hirer and the guarantor </string>
    <string name="hiredyn8">\n<b>The Finance Company and the Hirer</b></string>
    <string name="hiredyn9">    The finance company is the financier of the hire purchase transaction because at time it
    provides the funds for the purchase of the hire purchase goods either directly or indirectly. It
    funds the transaction directly when it purchases the goods itself to be let out to the hirer. It
    funds it indirectly when it lends money to a dealer/retailer to purchase the goods. Either way,
    it has been argued that the presence of a finance company in a hire purchase transaction is for
    the sole purpose of using hire purchase as a subterfuge/decoy for money lending.See
    <i>Andrew v. Hopkinson (1956) 3 ALL E.R. 422</i></string>
    <string name="hiredyn10">\n<b>The Finance Company and the Dealer/Retailer</b></string>
    <string name="hiredyn11">    The relationship between the finance company and the dealer is purely contractual. However, what
    matters is the nature of the contract involved. Where the finance company merely advances loan
    or credit facility to the dealer to purchase the goods, it is a loan agreement simpliciter
    The dealer through proposal form consummates the hire purchase agreement with the hirer, this
    time around with his name as the owner. What then is the legal effect of this arrangement? The
    law takes a firm position that the dealer is an agent of the finance company for the purpose of
    this transaction.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn12">  \n  However, the preponderance/majority of opinion is that the dealer as an agent should be regarded
    as general agent with unlimited scope of authority. Accordingly, he should be held liable for
    anything he does on behalf of the finance company. See
    <i>Financing Ltd v. Stimson (1962) 3 ALL E.R. 386</i></string>
    <string name="hiredyn13">\n<b> The Finance Company and the Guarantor</b> </string>
    <string name="hiredyn14">    At times, in the recourse agreement the finance company will insist on the dealer providing a
    guarantor. This is because in the real sense, the recourse agreement is a credit sale and the
    role of the guarantor is to ensure that the dealer pays back the purchase price of the goods in
    question.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn15">\n<b>The Owner and the Guarantor</b> </string>
    <string name="hiredyn16"> The relationship between the owner and the guarantor is purely that of a contract of guarantee,
    in which the guarantor undertakes to pay the monthly or the weekly instalments as the case may
    be in the event of the hirer‟s default. There is no requirement of consideration in monetary
       term flowing from the owner before the contract of guarantee can be enforced</string>
    <string name="hiredyn17">\n<b>The Hirer and the Guarantor</b></string>
    <string name="hiredyn18">    As between the hirer and the guarantor, the nature of their relationship is the contract of
    suretyship. This is a contract whereby the guarantor promises to act as a surety to the hirer in
    a hire purchase transaction with the owner.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn19">\n<b> OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES TO A HIRE PURCHASE AGREEMENT</b></string>
    <string name="hiredyn20">    Under the Hire Purchase Act, the parties are inundated with their respective obligations under
    the hire purchase agreement. These duties are contained in
    <i>sections 4 and 5 HPA.</i></string>
    <string name="hiredyn21">\n<b>Duties of the Owner</b></string>
    <string name="hiredyn22"> The duties of the owner under a hire purchase transaction are contained in section 4 HPA. These
      duties include:</string>
    <string name="hiredyn23">  \n  (a) An implied warranty that the hirer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of the goods.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn24">\n(b) An implied condition on the part of the owner that he shall have a right to sell the goods at the time when the property is to pass. The owner of the goods let under hire purchase is
    considered as having the title to the goods. In <i>Mercantile Union Guarantee Corporation Ltd v.
    Wheatley (1938) 1 K.B. 490
</i> when the learned judge, Goddard J. held that the material date at which the implied condition
    as to title arose was not the date of signing the agreement but the date of delivery of the
        goods to the prospective hirer.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn25">   \n (c) An implied warranty that the goods shall be free from any charge or encumbrance in favour of
    any third party at the time when the property is to pass. In <i>Onojefegwono v. Ogunbiade &amp; Anor
    (1976) 6 UILR 595</i>, Akpata J. of Benin High Court pointed out that: “One of the features of a
    hire purchase agreement is that until the hirer has paid the last of certain number of payments
    specified in the agreement, no property in the goods passed to the hirer. In fact, until the
    hirer pays the last instalment the property in the goods does not pass to him. He is nothing but
    a hirer who pays from time to time for the hire”.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn26"> \n(d) Except where the goods are let as second‐hand goods and the note or memorandum of the
    agreement made in pursuance of section 2 of this Act contains a statement to that effect, an
    implied condition that the goods shall be of merchantable quality, so however that no such
    condition shall be implied by virtue of this paragraph as regards defects of which the owner
    could not reasonably have been aware at the time when the agreement was made or, if the hirer
    has examined the goods or a sample of them, as regards defects which the examination ought to
       have revealed.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn27">  \n  The rule that the buyer must have expressly or impliedly make known to the seller the particular
    purpose for which he requires the goods usually applies where the goods can be used for more
    than one purpose</string>
    <string name="hiredyn28">\n<b>Duties of the Hirer</b> </string>
    <string name="hiredyn29">    The duties of the hirer are also encapsulated under the Hire Purchase Act. They include the
    following:</string>
    <string name="hiredyn30">\n1. The duty to take delivery of the goods; the hirer has a duty to accept delivery of the goods,
    the subject matter of the hire purchase. Such hirer will be liable in damages if he fails to
        take delivery within a reasonable time after he had been requested to do so.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn31">    \n2. Duty to take reasonable care of the goods, less wear and tear. It is generally implied that
    the hirer must take reasonable care of the goods under hire, or else he will be liable in
    conversion for loss or damage.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn32">    \n3. Duty to repair the goods. This duty is however subject to the express agreement by the
    parties. Ordinarily, the hirer is not liable for fair wear and tear, except for incidental
    repairs which may be necessary for proper functioning of the subject matter of the hire. Where
    the hirer has effected repairs if so required under the agreement, it is not ordinarily
    permissible for him to deduct his expenditures from the installmental payments due</string>
    <string name="hiredyn33">  \n  4. The duty not to deal with the goods in any manner inconsistent with the owner’s title. The
    hirer has a duty to use the goods for the purpose for which they were hired, for example, a
    transport lorry cannot be used as if it is a tipper lorry.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn34">\n5. The duty to pay installments as and when due. Perhaps, this is he most crucial of all the
    obligations of the hirer. The installments are the rents with which he services the contract of
    bailment. The installments are what is computed for the purpose of determining the hire purchase
    price.See
        <i>Ajayi v. R.T. Briscoe (1976) 1 NNLR 397</i></string>
    <string name="hiredyn35">    \n6. Duty to redeliver the goods to the owner if the hirer terminates the contract without
    exercising his option to purchase. The duty of the hirer in this regard is to ensure that the
    owner is not prevented from getting back the goods.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn36">  \n  7. The duty to inform the owner of any change in his residential or business address. This is
    important to enable the owner keep track of the movement or whereabouts of his property.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn37">\n<b>Remedies of the Parties</b>  </string>
    <string name="hiredyn38">    Where either party is in breach of the hire purchase agreement, the aggrieve party is entitled
    to any of the following remedies;</string>
    <string name="hiredyn39">    \n1. Injunction: where a party to the contract breaches or is likely to breach any of the terms
    and conditions of the contract, the party likely to be affected by such breach can seek an
    injunctive order to restrain the other party from such breach.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn40">  \n  2. Repossession: This remedy allows the owner to recover possession of the goods if the hirer is
    in default of the installmental payment. The right of repossession terminates the hire purchase
    agreement automatically and renders the hirer bereft of any possessory or proprietary claims to
    the goods.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn41">\n3. Action for repayment of installments: where the hirer is in default of the mandatory
    installmental payment, the owner can take an action for compel the hirer to fulfill his
        obligation to pay.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn42">    \n4. Damages: any party aggrieved under the contract can sue for damages for breach. The aim of
    this remedy is to restore the aggrieved party to the position he would have been but for the
    breach.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn43">  \n  5. Specific performance: where the hirer refuses to take delivery, the owner can sue for breach
    of contract. On the other hand, where the hirer has exercised his option to purchase and the
    owner refuses to sell the goods subject to the hire purchase agreement to him, the hire can sue
    for an order of specific performance to compel the owner to sell the vehicle to him.</string>
    <string name="hiredyn44">\n    6. Detinue: where the owner wrongfully repossesses the goods subject to the hire purchase
    agreement and convert same, the hirer can maintain an action in detinue against him.
</string>
    <string name="repo">Right Of Repossession</string>
    <string name="repo1"><b>Right of Repossession at Common Law</b></string>
    <string name="repo2">At Common law, the owner‟s right of repossession was largely unrestricted and unregulated. Accordingly, the owner can repossess for the slightest excuse at any time and with the use of selfhelp measures. The high point came in the case of <i>Atere Dada v. Amao</i></string>
    <string name="repo3">\nAt Common law, the owner could repossess even for one default of installmental payment. He need not go to court to seek an order of court before he can repossess. This unrestricted right of repossession left the hirer shortchanged hence the need for a statutory intervention.</string>
    <string name="repo4">\n<b>Repossession under the Act</b></string>
    <string name="repo5">The Hire Purchase Act intervened by introducing reforms to the right of repossession of goods subject to hire purchase agreement. This intervention came vide section 9 HPA. By virtue of section 9(1) of the Act, where goods have been let under a hire‐purchase agreement and the relevant proportion of the hire‐purchase price has been paid (whether in pursuance of a judgment or otherwise) or tendered by or on behalf of the hirer or any guarantor, the owner shall not enforce any right to recover possession of the goods from the hirer otherwise than by action in court and except as provided by subsection (5) of this section which is to the effect that where three or more installments of the hire‐purchase price of a motor‐vehicle under the agreement are due and unpaid, the owner may remove the motor vehicle to any premises under his control for the purpose of protecting it from damage or depreciation and retain it there pending the determination of any action, and the owner shall be liable to the hirer for any damage or loss which may be caused by the removal.</string>
    <string name="repo6">\n<i> Section 9(4) HPA</i> defines the phrase “the relevant proportion.” It defines it (a) In the case of goods other than motor vehicles, one‐half (1/2); and (b) In the case of motor vehicles, three‐fifths (3/5).</string>
    <string name="repo7">\n<i>Section 20 HPA</i> defines the phrase “motor vehicle” to mean any mechanically propelled vehicle intended or adapted for use on roads or for use for agricultural purposes.</string>
    <string name="repo8">\nIt has also been settled by the court that where the hirer has made the relevant payment and the owner still goes ahead to recover without the court, such repossession would be wrongful and unlawful. The hirer has a right of action for wrongful repossession. See <i>Adesanya v. Balogun and 30 Ors (Unreported) CCHCJ/11/73</i></string>
    <string name="repo9">\n<b>The Interim Right of Repossession</b></string>
    <string name="repo10"> The protection afforded the hirer under the Act by virtue of section 9(4) HPA was susceptible to abuses. Accordingly, in some cases, once the hirer has paid up the relevant proportion, he goes to sleep and leaves the owner helpless in the circumstance. Knowing the rigor of litigation and its time consuming nature especially for businessmen, the owners soon became the victims of the law.</string>
    <string name="repo11">\nFinally, there is also the question as to what is the affinity between section 9(5) on the interim right of repossession and section 10(3) of the Act as regard the general power of the court to make injunctive and preservative orders.</string>
    <string name="repo12">\nThere have been attempts to proffer answers to these questions both judicially and academically. On the judicial font the test case is <i>Ebohimi v. Nigeria Technical Ltd</i>. In this case, the hirer was in default of three installments and in what would have amounted to a fourth default, the hirer then tendered the arrears of the three installments as well as the payment for the fourth installment. The owner then without recourse to court repossessed. The issue was whether the owner was right in so doing. The court resolved that there is no doubt that once the hirer has made the relevant proportion he is protected, and further that the default must be consecutive and not cumulative, and that the owner must first institute an action in court and he can only recover for the purpose of preserving the goods.
</string>
    <string name="agency">Agency</string>
    <string name="agency1"><b>NATURE OF AGENCY</b></string>
    <string name="agency2"> The nature of agency deals with the relationship that arises when one person is used by another to carry out certain tasks on his behalf. The concept of agency in commercial transactions is a universal one. With the role played by agents as middlemen in the actualization of existence of contracts, it appears their existence is unavoidable.</string>
    <string name="agency3">\nThe basic intention behind the common law of agency can be explained thus: the law recognises that a person needs not always be the one to do all things that would alter or change his legal relations himself. The need may arise for him to utilize the services of another to change or alter them or to do something during the course of which there may be change. This other person is called the agent.</string>
    <string name="agency4">\nThis necessity for the employment or engagement of others to perform certain tasks on one‟s behalf is largely the result of the development of commercial transactions and the need for specialized activities in the fields such as commerce, industry (constructive, extractive, manufacturing and shipping industries) etc. Without agency, the modern commercial transaction could not operate. If there was no such concept as agency, only the owner of the business could make contracts on behalf of the company or business. Therefore, in order to give commercial activities business efficacy, there is the need for the engagement of some persons to do certain things for the business owner which could ordinarily have been unimaginable for that business owner to do by himself.</string>
    <string name="agency5">\nThus, where one person – the principal, requests another – the agent, to act on his behalf and that other person agrees to do so, the law recognises that the agent can affect, alter or change the principal‟s legal position by certain acts which, although performed by the agents, are not necessarily to be treated as the agent‟s own act but are to be treated in certain respect as if they were the acts of the principal</string>
    <string name="agency6">\n<b>DEFINITION OF AGENCY</b></string>
    <string name="agency7"> Agency is the relationship which arises whenever one person called the agent acts on behalf of another called the principal and the agent exercises power to effect the principal‟s legal position with regards to the third party</string>
    <string name="agency8">\nIt is pertinent to mention that the law of agency has no relevance to social or other non-legal obligations</string>
    <string name="agency9">\n<b>Classes of Agent</b></string>
    <string name="agency10">Before examining the major classes of agent, it is useful to distinguish between general agent and particular/special agent. The primary distinction between the two types lies in the nature of authority given or accorded to each and the extent to which their exercise with third parties affects the situation or position of the principal.</string>
    <string name="agency11">\nA general agent is an agent continuously employed or engaged to conduct a series of transactions on behalf of his principal. The <i>American Restatement of Agency</i>  defines a general agent as an agent who has the authority to conduct a series of transactions involving a continuity of service</string>
    <string name="agency12">\nA special agent on the other hand is employed or engaged to buy or sell a few objects in a oneoff shot. He is an agent authorized to act for and on behalf of his principal on or for a special or specific occasion.</string>
    <string name="agency13">\nThe following are the major types of agents:</string>
    <string name="agency14">\n1. Factor</string>
    <string name="agency15"> \n2. Broker</string>
    <string name="agency16">\n3. Del Credere Agent</string>
    <string name="agency17"> \n4. Auctioneer</string>
    <string name="agency18"> \n5. Estate Agent</string>
    <string name="agency19">\n6. Confirming House</string>
    <string name="agency20">\n<b>Factor</b></string>
    <string name="agency21"> A factor is an agent whose ordinary course of business is to sell or dispose-off goods which he is entrusted with the possession or control. He can transfer good title to whoever buys the goods from him</string>
    <string name="agency22">\n<b>Broker</b></string>
    <string name="agency23"> A broker is an agent whose ordinary course of business is to negotiate for the sale of goods and make contracts in respect of the sale. However, he is not endowed with the possession of the goods over which he does negotiate with the third party. In the same vein, he can negotiate with third party for the purchase of goods and other property such as shares, insurance policy, etc.</string>
    <string name="agency24">\n<b>Del Credere Agent</b></string>
    <string name="agency25"> This is an agent who in consideration of extra remuneration called the “del credere commission”, guarantees to his principal that third parties with whom he enters into contracts on behalf of the principal shall duly pay any sum becoming due under the contracts. In effect, a del credere agent is a surety to the principal for the due performance by the persons with whom he deals, of contracts made by him on behalf of the principal.</string>
    <string name="agency26">\n<b>Auctioneer</b></string>
    <string name="agency27">An auctioneer is one who sets up agency activities to sell goods or property at an auction sale. He does not guarantee that his principal has a valid title to the goods. He is entrusted with possession of the goods and therefore has a lien in the goods that are in his possession until the purchase price is paid.</string>
    <string name="agency28">\n<b>Estate Agent</b></string>
    <string name="agency29"> This is one who is engaged by an estate owner for the purpose of buying or selling real property (landed property). He is (usually) entitled to ten percent (10%) commission whenever he successfully achieves the result of his engagement. His engagement normally does not preclude his principal from selling or buying on his own, in which case the estate agent would be entitled at law to no commission</string>
    <string name="agency30">\n<b>Confirming House</b> \nThese are offices set up usually for the purpose of verifying and confirming contractual documents. This is very common in CIF contracts, FOB contracts, etc.</string>
    <string name="agency31">\n<b>CAPACITY OF PARTIES TO ENTER AGENCY RELATIONSHIP</b></string>
    <string name="agency32">\n<b>Capacity of Agent</b></string>
    <string name="agency33">An agent does not need to have full capacity to enable him function as such. This means that even an infant or a juvenile could be appointed an agent. The explanation for this is that agency relationship is consensual, it is not contractual. When therefore an agent is able to bring about the relationship between the third party and the principal, the agent drops out of the transaction to allow for the formation of the contract between the principal and the third party.</string>
    <string name="agency34">\nHowever, there is an exception to this general rule with regards to situations that make it relevant for an agent to have full capacity. The law believes that the principal may need to maintain an action against his erring agent. The principal can only maintain an action against one of full capacity. Therefore a principal who is a prudent man of business who is willing to appoint an agent as such should have one with full capacity in focus.</string>
    <string name="agency35">\nIt is important to stress that mentally ill persons are not competent to be agent or principal. This is especially so when the mental infirmity is such as to render him incapable of comprehending the true nature and probable consequences of his act.</string>
    <string name="agency36">\n<b>AUTHORITY OF AN AGENT</b></string>
    <string name="agency37">\n<b>Introduction</b></string>
    <string name="agency38"> Authority is the key to agency relationship and without it the agent cannot affect the principal‟s legal relations with a third party.</string>
    <string name="agency39">\nAn agent‟s authority may be derived from both an agreement between him and his principal, expressed or implied, or from operation of law. The authority of an agent could be: Real or actual authority, or  Ostensible or apparent authority</string>
    <string name="agency40">\n<b>The Actual or Real Authority</b></string>
    <string name="agency41"> The actual or real authority refers to the authority of the agent to do that which the principal has agreed that the agent should do for or on his behalf.</string>
    <string name="agency42">\nThe following should therefore be noted under real or actual authority.</string>
    <string name="agency43">\nExpress Actual Authority: this could be identified from the express intention of the principal‟s oral or written statement which causes the agent to believe that he/she has been authorized to act on behalf of the principal which could manifest in writing or orally given</string>
    <string name="agency44">\nActual Implied Authority: this is necessarily deriving from express authority. Giving that in the process of conferring on an agent real or actual authority, such authority may not be detailed enough to accommodate all unforeseen eventualities which the agent may face in the express authority, some things are therefore left to be implied.</string>
    <string name="agency45">\nUsual Authority: this is where the principal has put an agent in a position and the agent exercises power or carries out transactions which are usually carried out by persons who occupy such positions. Under this kind of implied authority, an agent is impliedly authorized to do anything which a similar agent in the same trade, profession or business would usually be authorized to do</string>
    <string name="agency46">\nCustomary authority – this is where the implied authority of the agent derives from custom, usage of trade, market, profession or business or community or locality.</string>
    <string name="agency47">\n<b>Apparent or Ostensible Authority</b></string>
    <string name="agency48"> This is an authority without agreement. The apparent or ostensible authority refers to authority which in fact does not but merely appears to exist. This means that the principal must have by his representation to a third party created an appearance of authority in the agent. The principal is therefore said to have held out the agent as possessing the authority to act on his behalf and would be estopped as against third party whenever the third party relied or has relied on the apparent authority so created.See <i>Spiro v. Limtern (1973) 3 All E.R. 319, Barret v. Deere (1928) Mood &amp; M 200</i>
</string>
    <string name="agecreate">Creation Of Agency</string>
    <string name="agecreate1"><b>Agency by Estoppel (Agency without Agreement)</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate2"> This is similar to ostensible/apparent authority discussed earlier. Where a person “principal” by his conduct or words represents to, or allows it to be represented that another person is his agent, he would not be permitted to deny the existence of the agency with respect to the third party. Ordinarily, the third party wants to know what the agent has power to do. The important question is, will the principal be bound by what the agent does? The third party cannot be expected to know everything that has gone on between the principal and the agent. The third party is therefore normally expected to rely on the appearances. So long as the agent is doing what he appears to have the authority to do, then the third party can effectively rely on this authority of the agent as deriving from the principal.</string>
    <string name="agecreate3">\n<b>Agency by Express Appointment</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate4"> The commonest way to appoint an agent is by express appointment of the said agent by the principal. Ordinarily, no formality such as writing is required for a valid appointment. This is so even though the contract which the agent is authorized to execute is one that is required by law to be evidenced in writing, such as the contract to buy or to take a lease at law. Thus, if an agent is appointed orally to sign a contract in his own name for the purchase of land, the principal can give parol (oral) evidence to show the existence of the agency and can enforce the contract against either the agent or the third party</string>
    <string name="agecreate5">\n<b>Agency By Ratification</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate6"> It is worthy of note that the effect of ratification is that it relates back to the time the agent made the contract with the third party and the principal becomes liable. Ratification is therefore retroactive. As a general rule, a plaintiff commencing an action and a person to be made a defendant to the action must be a juristic person or natural persons existing at the time action was commenced, otherwise the action will be incompetent and the court will lack jurisdiction. See <i>Okechukwu &amp; Sons v. Ndah (1967) NWLR 368</i> where it was held that: “If it is successfully shown that a party to an action is not a legal person, that party should be struck out of the suit, and if such party was expressed to be the plaintiff the action should be struck out.”</string>
    <string name="agecreate7">\nFor agency by ratification to be possible, four conditions must be satisfied before, namely;</string>
    <string name="agecreate8">\n1.	The agent must have used the principal‟s name and claimed to be acting on his behalf. In <i>Folashade v. Alhaji Duroshola (1961) All NLR 87</i>, it was held that there could be no ratification unless a person  purports to act as an agent and to act for a particular person.</string>
    <string name="agecreate9">\n2.	The principal must be in existence and have contractual capacity at the material time the agent entered into the contract.</string>
    <string name="agecreate10">\n3.	The principal must have been aware of all material facts at the time when he ratified the contract. Otherwise, his ratification will not bind him</string>
    <string name="agecreate11">\n4.	An illegal and totally void contract cannot be ratified. Thus, forged signatures or things done for the corporate body which are ultra vires the body cannot be cured by ratification.</string>
    <string name="agecreate12">\n<b>Agency by Pressure of Necessity</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate13">This is the agent which arose from the pressure of necessity. Exceptionally, a person, that is, an “agent” may acquire authority from the pressure of necessity. For this to happen, there must have been situation and relationship involving one, latter to be called an agent, and the other, latter to be called the “principal”.</string>
    <string name="agecreate14">\nFour conditions must be satisfied for this agency to be created. These include:</string>
    <string name="agecreate15">\n1.	The “agent” must have been placed in control of the “principal‟s” property/goods. This shows that there must have been contractual relationship of some sorts between the parties.</string>
    <string name="agecreate16">\n2.	A genuine emergency must have arising which threatens the property. This may occur for example where the property is perishable and storage or transport facility could possibly have broken down.</string>
    <string name="agecreate17">\n3.	There must have been impossibility of seeking the owner‟s instruction in time owing to the breakdown of communication facilities. This was the situation in <i>Great Northern Railway Corporation v. Sqaffield</i></string>
    <string name="agecreate18">\n4.	The agent must have been acting in good faith in a genuine desire or attempt to protect the property.</string>
    <string name="agecreate19">\n<b>Agency by Cohabitation (Agency by Implication of Law)</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate20">The fact of cohabitation may also create an agency. Where a husband and wife live together, there is a presumption that the wife has a right to pledge the husband‟s credit for necessaries and this right emanates not from the fact of marriage but from the fact of cohabitation. Consequently, where a man and a woman live together and cohabit as husband and wife, although they are not married, agency of cohabitation is created.</string>
    <string name="agecreate21">\nInstructive here is the case of <i>Phillipson v. Hayter (1870) L.R. 6 C.P. 38 at 42</i>, where it was held that a wife or mistress has authority to contract for things that are really necessary in accord with the man‟s station in life. It is important to mention that such right is lost and so the husband will not be bound to pay as the principal under the following conditions:</string>
    <string name="agecreate22">\na.	Where the wife or mistress is adequately supplied with necessaries,</string>
    <string name="agecreate23">\nb.	Where she has enough allowance for the purchase of necessaries,</string>
    <string name="agecreate24">\nc.	  Where the man earlier warn the tradesman or store owner not to supply goods to her when her authority for necessaries is exceeded,</string>
    <string name="agecreate25">\nd.	 Where the goods obtained by the wife or mistress were supplied exclusively on the woman‟s credit and not of the man, and</string>
    <string name="agecreate26">\ne.	 Where the woman or mistress is one of means.</string>
    <string name="agecreate27">\n<b>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRINCIPAL AND THIRD PARTIES</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate28">\n<b>Category of Principal</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate29">A principal could be:</string>
    <string name="agecreate30">\n1. Named Principal,</string>
    <string name="agecreate31">\n2. Disclosed Principal, and</string>
    <string name="agecreate32">\n3. Undisclosed Principal.</string>
    <string name="agecreate33">\n<b>Named Principal</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate34">A named principal is one whose name has been revealed to the third party by the agent. In such circumstances, the third party knows that the agent is contracting as an agent and knows also the person on whose behalf the agent is acting</string>
    <string name="agecreate35">\n<b>Disclosed Principal</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate36">A disclosed principal is one whose existence has been revealed to a third party but whose exact identity or name is unknown. Here, the third party knows that the agent is contracting as agent but he is unaware of the name of the principal on whose behalf the agent is contracting because the name is not revealed to him.</string>
    <string name="agecreate37">\n<b>Undisclosed Principal</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate38"> An undisclosed principal is one whose identity or the fact that the agent is acting on behalf of someone else is not revealed to the third party with whom the agent contracts. Under this arrangement, the third party does not know that the agent is acting as agent and therefore believes honestly that he is contracting personally.</string>
    <string name="agecreate39">\n<b>The Importance of the Distinction of Classes of Principals</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate40">The distinction of the classes of principals is important because the class in which a principal falls may affect the issue of personal liability of the agent or what the principal is free from the benefit of, or the burden of the contract made by an agent.</string>
    <string name="agecreate41">\n<b>Where the Agent Asks For a Named or Disclosed Principal</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate42"> a. The position of the principal and the third party with regards to contract: if an agent makes a contract with third party on behalf of a disclosed principal, the agent drops out of the contract and the principal can sue a third party to the contract and he can also be sued by the same third party to the contract. There are however some exceptions to the bindingness of the contract on the principal, viz:</string>
    <string name="agecreate43">\ni. If the third party has notice of the agent‟s lack of authority, he cannot hold the principal liable nor can the contract be binding on the principal.</string>
    <string name="agecreate44">\nii. Where the authority of an agent is restricted by custom of the trade or other usages known to the third party, in the absence of express authority of the principal overriding such usage or custom, the principal will not be bound by such contract. For this proposition there is the case of <i>Grant v. Norway (1851) 10 C.D. 65</i></string>
    <string name="agecreate45">\niii. Where an agent contracts by Deed, the principal will not be able to sue and be sued on the contract unless he is described in the Deed as a party to it and that it is executed in his own name. For this proposition there is a case of <i>Abina v. Farat</i>. In that case, the court held that a deed signed by an agent on verbal authority was inoperative</string>
    <string name="agecreate46">\nb. The position of the principal and third party with regards to payment of money to agent: it is a common feature of the law of agency that many a time the principal entrusts money to the agent for onward transmission to the third party and also the third party may settle with the agent with a view to the money being transmitted to the principal. The legal effect in either circumstance if the agent absconds with the money is hereby considered:</string>
    <string name="agecreate47">\ni. Payment to agent by the principal: if the conduct of the third party positively indicates to the principal that the agent has fully executed the principal‟s obligation to the third party, and in consequence the principal pays the agent, the principal will not be liable to make the same payment over to the third party whenever such agent absconds with the money paid to him by the principal.</string>
    <string name="agecreate48">\nii. Where payment is made by the third party to the agent: generally, payment to an agent by a third party will not discharge the third party. However, there are certain exceptions to this general rule.</string>
    <string name="agecreate49">\n1. If the agent have authority to receive payment on behalf of the principal, then payment to the agent would be regarded at law as payment to the principal.</string>
    <string name="agecreate50"> \n2. Where the agent was not authorized to receive money but he, however, received money and paid same to the principal, the third party would be discharged and would never again be made to pay that same money all over.</string>
    <string name="agecreate51">\n3. Where the agent has a lien on the principal‟s goods and payment is made by a third party through the agent to the principal but the agent fails to hand over the money to the principal, the third party would be discharged to the limit of the value of the lien over the goods</string>
    <string name="agecreate52">\n4. The third party would be discharged if by the conduct of the principal the third party is made to believe that the agent contracted as the principal.</string>
    <string name="agecreate53">\n<b>Undisclosed principal</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate54">\n<b>Where the Agent Asks For an Undisclosed Principal</b></string>
    <string name="agecreate55"> If an agent signs a document without indicating that he merely does so as agent, then a court may be reluctant to admit or may not believe oral evidence that the document which appears to bind the agent in fact only binds someone else called the “principal”. This is simply a question of evidence. Any agent who wishes to escape personal liability should always add words like “as agent” or “as Director” etc. after his signature. Any deviation renders the agent directly and personally liable to the third party.

    <string name="ageduties">Duties And Obligations Of Parties To Agency Relationship</string>
    <string name="ageduties1">This refers to the duties which the principal and the agent owe each other. There are also corresponding rights available to each other and from one another. Consequently, the following are the duties.</string>
    <string name="ageduties2">\na.	The duties of agent to the principal</string>
    <string name="ageduties3">\nb.The duties of principal to the agent</string>
    <string name="ageduties4">\n<b> The Duties of Agent to the Principal </b></string>
    <string name="ageduties5">These refer to the duties owe the principal by the agent. These include:</string>
    <string name="ageduties6">\ni.	The duty to obey lawful instructions: this is otherwise known as the duty of obedience. An agent must obey his principal‟s instruction and if he fails so to do, he would be liable for damages to the principal. <i>Turpin v. Bilton (1843) 5 Man. &amp; G. 455 C.P</i>.</string>
    <string name="ageduties7">\nii.	 The duty of personal performance: an agent cannot validly delegate his duties to a sub-agent, although he may have implied authority to entrust mere secretariat and routine administrative duties to his or other employees. He may also delegate with the authority of the principal, or in the case of necessity, or in accordance with the custom of the trade, business or profession. <i>Henderson v. Merritt Syndicate (1994) CLC 55</i></string>
    <string name="ageduties8">\niii.	The duty of care and skills: an agent must use such duty of care and diligence as is reasonable in all the circumstances. Moreover, if he has professed some special skills he must show the degree of care and skill ordinarily expected of persons in his profession.<i> Harmer v. Cornelius (1958) 5 Q.B. 236,</i></string>
    <string name="ageduties9">\niv(a). The duty of utmost good faith: an agent must never permit an undisclosed conflict of interest, that is, he must not allow his own interest to conflict with those of the principal. In <i>Bently v. Craven (1883) 18 Beav. 75</i>,the agent who had earlier bought some quantity of sugar for himself, at a time when the price was low, was employed to buy sugar for the firm. He sold his own sugar to the firm at the current market price, thereby making considerable profit without disclosing this fact. It was held that he must account to the firm for the profit.</string>
    <string name="ageduties10">\n(b). An agent must not act for both sides (i.e. principal and third party) without full disclosure to the principal.In  <i>Fullwood v. Hurley (1928) 1 K.B. 498</i>,an agent was engaged by the owner to sell a Commercial Law II – BUL 321 56 Comrade Wisdom Notes hotel, and without disclosing his connection with the owner, arranged the sale and claimed commission from both the seller and the buyer by the agent. He was held not entitled to commission from the buyer.</string>
    <string name="ageduties11">\n(c). An agent must account to this principal for all monies received in the course of his agency and must take care not to mix his own money and property with those of the principal.</string>
    <string name="ageduties12"> \n(d). An agent owes strict duties of disclosure to his principal but secrecy towards others. The duty of confidentiality in focus is captured in <i>Bolkiah v. KPMG (1999) 2 A.C. 222; [1999] 1 All ER 517, [1999] 2 WLR 215.</i></string>
    <string name="ageduties13">\nv. An agent must not make secret profit from the use of his position. See <i>Mahensan v. Malaysia Govt. Officers Co-operative Housing Society (1978) 2 All E.R. 405; (1979) A.C. 374.</i></string>
    <string name="ageduties14">\nvi. An agent must not take any bribe as such, that is, any payment or gift to induce him to act in favour of the donor.</string>
    <string name="ageduties15">\n<b>The Duties of Principal to the Agent</b></string>
    <string name="ageduties16">These are the duties owe the agent by the principal. These duties include:</string>
    <string name="ageduties17">\n1.	Duty to pay agreed commission: agency can be gratuitous, but if commission or other payment is agreed, expressly or impliedly, the principal must pay the agreed amount. If the agent is in business and would not ordinarily act gratuitously, there may be an implied obligation to pay a reasonable sum normally by reference to usual commercial or professional rate. Luxol (East Bourne) Ltd v Cooper (1941) All E.R. 33</string>
    <string name="ageduties18">\n2.	Duty of indemnity: the principal must indemnify his agent for expenses properly and legally incurred in executing his duties. This is payment made to compensate, by way of refund, of all expenses the agent may have incurred in the course of serving his principal
</string>
    <string name="termagency">Termination Of Agency</string>
    <string name="termagency1">Generally, under the law of contract which by extension applies to commercial transactions, parties to an agreement usually state the modes by which their contractual relationship may come to an end. The incidence of agency termination touches first and foremost the relationship between the agent and the principal. It also touches that of third party. Accordingly, upon the termination of an agency relationship, it becomes imperative to consider the legal positions not only between the principal and the agent, but also between each of these respectively and any third party with whom the agent has had dealings. This rule is also applicable to agency contract.</string>
    <string name="termagency2"> \nBasically, agency relationship can come to an end in the following ways:</string>
    <string name="termagency3"> 1. By the act of the Parties; and</string>
    <string name="termagency4">\n 2. By operation of law</string>
    <string name="termagency5">\n<b>By the act of the Parties</b></string>
    <string name="termagency6">\nSubject to the operation of the principle of irrevocable authority, an agency relationship may be terminated by an act of the principal or and the agent.This can occur in any of the three ways discussed hereunder:</string>
    <string name="termagency7">\n1.	By agreement: the general nature of relationship of principal and agent is primarily consensual. It is generally considered as good sense to allow the parties the freedom to be able to terminate their relationship when it is no longer beneficial to them or fulfilling their purpose.</string>
    <string name="termagency8">\n2.	Revocation: an agency relationship is generally presumed to have been created, formed or established for the benefit of the principal. It therefore follows that he is generally also free at any time to revoke the agency or any authority granted to the agent when he considers that the object or purpose is no longer attainable or when that benefit is no longer accruing to him. Revocation is the unilateral termination of agency relationship by the principal.<i> See Alexander Logios v. Att. General of Nigeria (1938)4 W.A.C.A. 163.</i></string>
    <string name="termagency9">\n3.	Renunciation: while revocation occurs where the principal unilaterally terminates his relationship with the agent, renunciation on the other hand occurs where the agent unilaterally terminates his relationship with his principal. Here it is the agent who initiates the termination</string>
    <string name="termagency10">\n4. Closure of business: where the principal‟s business closes, it necessarily follows that the agency relationship between him and the agent automatically closes since there would be nothing for the agent to act upon.</string>
    <string name="termagency11">\n<b>Termination by operation of law</b></string>
    <string name="termagency12"> This is the second way by which agency relationship can be terminated. Under certain conditions or circumstances, it may become impossible of undesirable for an agency relationship to continue or to be continued</string>
    <string name="termagency13">\nTermination of Agency by operation of law can occur under any of the circumstances to be discussed under</string>
    <string name="termagency14">1.	By Performance: in cases where an agent is given an authority to accomplish or achieve a specific result, it accords with reason that the authority terminates upon the object of the power being accomplished.</string>
    <string name="termagency15">\n2.	By Effluxion of Time: it is also generally expected that the authority of an agent which was conferred on him for a specific period of time terminates or ceases automatically upon the expiration of that period of time. The agency relationship terminates at the expiration of such period of time irrespective of whether the task or object contemplated by its creation or formation has been accomplished or not.</string>
    <string name="termagency16">\n3.	By Frustration: where an agency agreement exists between the principal and the agent, it may be terminated by the operation of the doctrine of frustration. This doctrine operates in situations when two people enter into a contract of agency which is dependent for the possibility of its performance on the continued existence or availability of a specific thing or matter</string>
    <string name="termagency17">\n4.	By Death of Principal or Agent: death is inevitable to every living being ordinarily. Save in cases of irrevocable authority, the death of a principal or agent terminates the agency relationship unless there is an express or implied stipulation to the contrary in their arrangement. In <i>Phillips v. Jones (1888)4 T.L.R. 401</i>, It was held that the authority of a broker, express or implied, terminated on the death of the principal.</string>
    <string name="termagency18">\n5.	By Insanity of Principal or Agent: one of the basic ingredients of a valid contract is that the parties to such an agreement must be of sound mind. In an agency situation, this rule is also applicable and where the insanity or mental incapacity of the principal or the agent occurs, except in cases of irrevocable authority, the relationship ordinarily terminates.</string>
    <string name="termagency19">\n6.	By Bankruptcy of Principal or Agent: the agency relationship of principal and agent ordinarily terminates at the bankruptcy of either the principal or agent. Where the principal becomes bankrupt his estate by law falls to be administered by his trustee in bankruptcy. The effect of this is that the authority of an agent appointed by him automatically terminates for a different principal is created in the trustee in bankruptcy</string>
    <string name="termagency20">\n<b>Conclusion</b></string>
    <string name="termagency21">Generally, termination of agency by operation of law depends on the various circumstances of each or any given agency relationship. In the absence of notable exceptions, the happening of any of the above noted situations automatically put an end to the agency relationship between the principal and the agent.

    <string name="oiltrans">Transportation in Oil And Gas</string>
    <string name="oiltrans1">After crude oil has been produced it is transported to refineries. Crude oil has to be transported from the well head through a network of pipelines to the storage tanks and from there to the refining facilities; onward to the point of transportation to the final consumer. This is the situation whether oil is being exported or being used locally since the usefulness of oil only becomes apparent after it has been refined. Pipelines are a unique form of transportation used to move liquids, gases, or solid/liquid mixtures over great distances. Pipelines consist of two major components: pipes and pumping stations</string>
    <string name="oiltrans2">\nOil pipelines have remained very important in the transportation of oil and gas. Gas pipelines are made to transport natural gas form the points of extraction to the point where they are to be used or exported. It has become the major means of transporting crude oil because of its versatility and advantage over the use of vehicle tankers.</string>
    <string name="oiltrans3">\nIn some countries a lot of revenue is made from the operation of oil pipelines by the companies that undertake such project. The companies upon obtaining the requisite approval construct oil pipelines underground and make it available not only to their own crude oil but for the use of other oil companies on agreed conditions.</string>
    <string name="oiltrans4">\nThe transportation of oil and gas is regulated by the <i>Oil Pipeline Act, Cap 338, of 1956</i> and it also governed by subsidiary legislation like the <i>Oil and Gas Pipeline Regulation of 1995.</i></string>

    <string name="petroltax">Petroleum Taxation And Fiscal Regime</string>
    <string name="petroltax1">The main source government gets revenue from petrochemical industries is through taxes, and this is done through the application of the provision of the <i>Petroleum Profit Tax Act of 1968 Part 354 LFN </i>1990. The Act is applied mainly for the purpose of assessment and imposition of tax on the profit of companies engage in petroleum operations separately from those of other companies engaged in other enterprises.The Act came into force on 1 January 1958 and has undergone several amendments.</string>
    <string name="petroltax2">\nIt is important to mention that the government only get tax from chargeable oil, and by the provisions of section 8 PPTA tax can only be charged on the proceeds of sale of all chargeable oil or the disposal of same and also on all income incidental to and arising from petroleum operation.</string>
    <string name="petroltax3">By the provisions of <i>section 10 PPTA</i>, the petroleum company is allowed to remove certain outgoing expenses that cannot be subject to tax otherwise known as deductible charges.</string>
    <string name="petroltax4">\nDeductible charges are those expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by oil companies in the course of its oil operation which are not subject to taxation. These deductibles include;</string>
    <string name="petroltax5">\n1. Rent on land and buildings occupied</string>
    <string name="petroltax6">\n2. All sums paid as customs and excise duties as charges on machines and equipment majorly for the purpose of its operations</string>

    <string name="liquigas4"> Many reasons account for the slow pace of development in the Nigeria gas venture. Some of these reasons include;</string>
    <string name="liquigas5"> \n1. The high capital intensive nature of a gas re-injection scheme</string>
    <string name="liquigas6">\n2. The joint venture style giving NNPC 60% in the agreement means that Nigeria government will have to provide a bigger part of the capital needed which of course the government of the day is not ready to do.</string>

    <string name="liquigas10">\n6. The international oil companies find it easier to flare gas because it is cheaper to flare than to re-inject.</string>
    <string name="liquigas11">\n7. There is the absence of solid enforcement agencies to help in stopping gas flaring in Nigeria because there is the absence of political will to fight against gas flaring.</string>

    <string name="liquigas13"> With the enormous gas reserve, the Nigeria government first promulgated the Associated Gas Re-injection Act, 1979 proposing that oil companies should stop gas flaring or face sanction. This Act was however violated for lack of enforcement. Another Act was enacted in 1984 with new provisions prohibiting gas flaring but with subjective provisions in that it gave room for gas flaring and since oil companies knew that it would be more difficult for them to re-inject and of course more expensive, they prefer to flare the gas by either getting the permission from the Minister or face the penalty of paying the fine.</string>
    <string name="liquigas14">\nThose given the right to flare gas were given certificate to flare by the Minister in charge of petroleum affairs and as at the time of the enactment of this Act, 86 out of 155 of the then oil companies were given certificates to flare gas. In 1990 the government came up with the Nigeria Liquefied National Gas provisions. Under this Act, the oil company of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas was registered with NNPC having 49% interest, Shell – 24% interest, Elf – 15% interest, and Agip – 10% interest.</string>
    <string name="liquigas15"> \nAbout 3.8 billion dollars was invested in building the gas plant with a production capacity of 5.7 billion metric tonnes per year. There were incentives such that every loan gotten from foreign countries did not attract tax and contractors were given rebates on whatever material they imported.</string>
    <string name="liquigas16">\nA major drawback in the establishment of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas is the inclusion of the stabilization clauses (that is, sanctity of contract in the agreement with the international oil companies) which favours the international oil companies rather than the host country – Nigeria, notwithstanding the excuse of attracting more foreign investors

    <string name="arbioil">Arbitration Of Oil Disputes</string>
    <string name="arbioil1">Dispute settlement is a fundamental aspect of any existing legal system which necessarily ought to be by a non-violent means. This dispute settlement is a means of protecting international contracts and one of such means is by arbitration which is a legal method of resolving disputes between parties outside the ordinary court procedure by the parties deliberately submitting themselves to the decision of a third party arbitration consensually agreed upon.</string>
    <string name="arbioil2"> \nArbitration as it were, is a private process which commences with the agreement of parties to an existing dispute to submit their dispute for a decision to a tribunal of one or more arbitrators</string>
    <string name="arbioil3">\n<b>Why Arbitration</b></string>
    <string name="arbioil4"> Arbitration has become attractive to both the host countries and the international oil companies due to the following reasons;</string>
    <string name="arbioil5">\n1. Because of the technical nature of oil and gas industry, an arbitrator with special knowledge which may not be found in the ordinary court room is therefore required.</string>
    <string name="arbioil6">\n2. Because of the high degree of sophisticated contract drafted by professionals thus requiring professional dispute resolution and interpretation</string>
    <string name="arbioil7"> \n3. Because of the overlapping commercial interest and long standing contractual relationships between oil and gas companies and the host countries to avoid destroying the goods relationship built over the years.</string>
    <string name="arbioil8"> \n4. Speed and cost saving.</string>
    <string name="arbioil9"> \n5. Simplicity of procedure for settlement as against the hitherto process of going through the rigorous procedure required by the ordinary court room.</string>
    <string name="arbioil10">\n<b>Early Development Stage of Arbitration</b></string>
    <string name="arbioil11">International arbitration developed majorly towards the end of the 20th century as colonialism began to wind up. The use of guns and bombs to settle disputes became unattractive, thus, international norms were developed against the use of force particularly Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter of 1945. Peaceful means of settling international disputes was however preferred.</string>
    <string name="arbioil12">\n<b>The Doctrine of Severability in the use of Arbitration Clause</b></string>
    <string name="arbioil13">The doctrine of severability is to the effect that arbitration clause ought to have a life of its own, that it should exist independently, separate and distinct from the main oil investment contract. According to this school of thought, an arbitration clause needs not end with the main contract. They believe that the existence of an arbitration clause is not dependent on the continuous existence of the main investment contract.</string>
    <string name="arbioil14">\nHowever, another school of thought argues that as the main investment contract ends, an arbitration clause automatically ends with it. To this school of thought, a valid law that can destroy a contract should as well have the effect of destroying all the clauses including the arbitration clause.</string>
    <string name="arbioil15">\nHowever, it is pertinent to mention that despite the general acceptance of the doctrine of severability, it will become ineffective in the following circumstances: 1. Where such a clause fraudulently finds its way into a contract. That is, where an arbitration clause was inserted fraudulently by one of the parties. 2. Where there has never been a valid agreement. That is, where no substantive contract ever existed between the parties, such as in the case of void contract. 3. Where the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law which the parties have indicated or agreed to be applied.</string>
    <string name="arbioil16">\n<b>The Applicable Law to Oil Investment Dispute</b></string>
    <string name="arbioil17">The specific law applicable to the merit of an oil investment dispute is very critical to the integrity of arbitration of oil investment dispute. There are several laws from which an arbitrator can pick and choose in giving justice to the parties. Some of these include:</string>
    <string name="arbioil18"> \n1. Express Choice of Law: generally speaking, parties to an investment contract can expressly or impliedly determine the applicable law to the merit of their dispute. This act of the parties choosing the applicable law is known as the “Autonomy of the Will”.</string>
    <string name="arbioil19">\n2. Municipal law of the Host Country:  This view is premised on the political self-affirmation of developing countries affirmed by the United Nation Resolution of the country’s natural resources and also the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States which has emphasised the idea that foreign investment should be strictly regulated by municipal laws</string>
    <string name="arbioil20">\n3. International law. In this case the applicable law is public international law. This practice is highly supported and embraced by developed countries and the international oil companies. The origin of the theory of internationalization of oil investment contracts could be found in the disputes arising from petroleum concession in the Middle Eastern States. The proponents of internationalisation of oil investment contracts argued that oil investment contracts should be governed by the principles and rules of public international law.</string>
    <string name="arbioil21">\n4. General principle of law: here, the parties do not specify any particular law to govern their contract. It is argued that where this is the case, the contract should be governed by the general principle of law recognized by civilized nations. According to Lord McNair, a supporter of this view, the application of this general principle would depend on two things:</string>
    <string name="arbioil22">\ni. The fact that many host countries have a system of law which has not yet developed to deal with this particular type of transaction; and</string>
    <string name="arbioil23"> \nii. The fact that the parties do not specify the applicable law but agree to submit their disputes to arbitration.</string>
    <string name="arbioil24">\n6. Quasi international law. A school of thought contends that oil investment contract should be regarded as quasi international agreements. Supporter of this view believed that these agreements are neither governed by some municipal law of some States nor are they international treaties since they are not concluded between subjects of international law
</string>
    <string name="sovres">Principle Of Permanent Soveriegnty Over Natural Resources</string>
    <string name="sovres1">Prior to the United Nations declaration of permanent sovereignty over natural resources, most international oil companies were dealing with the natural resources of the host countries in a manner inconsistent with the ownership of the resources of the host countries. Realising that the peace of the international community was at risk if the evil trend of the investorownership is not curtailed, and that there may be a global unrest and tussle between the host countries and the international oil companies, the United Nations Resolution 1803 (SVII) of December 1962 also known as the land mark Resolution tagged “Declaration of Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources” was passed. This resolution was assented to by countries of the world consisting of not less than 85 nations. The major thrust of this Resolution is that all the natural resources found in the host country belong to the host country and thus, the international oil companies were restricted from dealing with the resources in a way that questions the ownership of the owners of the resources.</string>
    <string name="sovres2">\n<b>Stages of the Development of the Declaration</b></string>
    <string name="sovres24">The origin and development of the principle of sovereignty over natural resources can be divided into four phases.</string>
    <string name="sovres3">\nThe first phase is between 1952 and 1962. Within this period of time, the international community especially the United Nations were strictly concerned with establishing people’s rights to use and enjoy their natural resources as a right inherent in their nationhood or sovereignty thereby leading to the birth of the declaration of permanent sovereignty over natural resources by Resolution 1803 of December 14, 1962 signed by 87 countries out of 101 countries.</string>
    <string name="sovres4">\nThe second stage is between 1962 and 1973. Within this period of time, there was the adoption, reiteration and re-affirmation of the land mark resolution by other smaller resolutions. The first is resolution 88 of 1972. The next is Resolution 2158 of 1966. The other is Resolution 22 of 1970, followed by Resolution 3171 of 1973.</string>
    <string name="sovres5">\nThe third phase relates to the incorporation of the principles of permanent sovereignty over natural resources in the Declaration of Establishment of a New International Economic Order, resolution 3021 of May 1974 and Article 2 of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States which was adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 3281 of December 1974.</string>
    <string name="sovres6">\nDuring the fourth phase, several investment agreements concluded by some developing countries, particularly agreements with the oil exporters went through a series of amendments in order to bring them in line with the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources.</string>
    <string name="sovres7">\n<b>Benefits of the Resolution</b></string>
    <string name="sovres8">1. The recognition of the principle of permanent sovereignty gave room to developing countries to carry out developmental plans, seeing that they have been given the power to determine how, when and to what extent to use or not to use their natural resources.</string>
    <string name="sovres9"> \n2. The recognition of principle of permanent sovereignty has helped the developing countries in raising their standard of living.</string>
    <string name="sovres10">\n3. The birth of the Resolution has brought about freedom from economic colonialism and oppression.</string>
    <string name="sovres11">\n4. The application of the principle of sovereignty over natural resources has helped in enforcing the principle of self-determination.</string>
    <string name="sovres12">\n5. The recognition of the principle has enhanced developing countries natural rights such as the right of a State to dispose-off, at its discretion, its own natural resources.</string>
    <string name="sovres13"> \n6. The recognition of the declaration has also brought about a movement from concession agreement to equity participation and joint ventures whereby the host countries now fully participate in the running, exploitation, exploration and marketing of the natural resources as joint partners.</string>
    <string name="sovres14">\n7. The application of the principle of sovereignty over natural resources has brought about the maximization of profit by restructuring existing arrangement which has led to development of new styles of contract.</string>
    <string name="sovres15">\nIn the case of <i>Texaco Petroleum Development Co and California Asiatic Co v. Libya </i> and the case of <i>American Independent Oil Co v. Government of Kuwait</i>, the arbitrators in these two cases stated that the principle of sovereignty over natural resources has become an important rule of jurisprudence guiding against any act, contract or treaty that is against the natural resources of the host country.</string>
    <string name="sovres16">\n<b>Permanent Sovereignty Mode of Acquisition of Oil Right</b></string>
    <string name="sovres17"> It must be noted that the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources has become a driving force in the realisation of new styles or mode of acquisition of oil right. It has been able to answer to the agitation of the true owners of the natural resources thereby making their ownership a living reality. The principle, in doing this, brought about alteration of inequitable and unfair legal agreement.</string>
    <string name="sovres18">\n<b>Indices to Show the Application of Resolution 1803 by Host Countries</b></string>
    <string name="sovres19">1. The arrangement of contract must be for the overall development and wellbeing of the host country.</string>
    <string name="sovres20">\n2. The arrangement of contract must be in accordance with the host country’s legislation</string>
    <string name="sovres21">\n3. The arrangement of contract must be freely entered into and freely agreed upon.</string>
    <string name="sovres22"> \nA host country would be said to be making the best use of the application of the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources when the agreement entered into is to its benefit and development.</string>
    <string name="sovres23">\nIn summary therefore, the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources can be referred to as the real source of inspiration for the host countries and has helped in the shifting of bargaining power from the international oil companies to the host countries by encouraging State participation, bring about equitable sharing of profit as well as stressing on the use of renegotiation clauses for the overall interest of the host country.
</string>
    <string name="pettech">Transfer of Petroleum Technology</string>
    <string name="pettech1">The overall aim of any oil producing country is to control and operate all sectors of its oil industry. Seeing that the majority of the oil producing States do not have the capacity for effective petroleum technology, the international oil companies ultimately remains the principal agent for conveying petroleum technology even though the act of transferring petroleum technology does not seem profitable to the international oil companies. In the bid to achieving the transfer of petroleum technology, Nigeria had taken certain steps in the past by enacting laws, for example, the Petroluem Drilling and Production Regulation of 1969 which obligates the holders of oil mining and oil prospecting licenses to strictly train and employ Nigerians in all sectors of the oil industry. This regulation mandated all oil operators to submit detail report on the training of Nigerians once a year and failure to adhere to this often led to the revoking of licenses.</string>
    <string name="pettech2"> \nSubsequently, other major contractual agreement between NNPC and the international oil companies also include terms dealing with these issues of training and transfer of petroleum technology. These contracts obligated the contractors to make maximum use of Nigerians as effective manpower in the conduct of petroleum operation. The training of local manpower included the training of unskilled clerical supervisors and technical managers.</string>
    <string name="pettech3">\nIn the transfer of petroleum technology have not been made possible for developing countries because of the sophisticated and capital intensive nature of petroleum technology which easily becomes obsolete because of the consistent changes that keep cropping up as a result of researches leading to new discoveries.</string>
    <string name="pettech4">\n<b>Aspects of Transfer of Technology</b></string>
    <string name="pettech5"> Transfer of technology is divided into two aspects. These are</string>
    <string name="pettech6">\n1. Intangible transfer of petroleum technology,</string>
    <string name="pettech7">\n2. Tangible transfer of petroleum technology</string>
    <string name="pettech8">\nThe intangible aspect of technology transfer has to do with knowledge and skills together with the ability to translate this knowledge and skills to effect repairs, maintenance and create innovation in the oil industry.</string>
    <string name="pettech9"> \nThe tangible aspect of technology transfer has to do with physical technology like equipment, tools, machineries and plant. The transfer of one without the other will lead to technological dependence by the host oil producing country. It is the quest for the transfer of technology that gave rise to the insertion of the principle of permanent sovereignty.</string>
    <string name="pettech10">\nScholars have argued that the ability to transfer technology does not rest squarely with the international oil companies. They argued that the transfer of technology can effectively be achieved through the process of training and adequate exposure of Nigerians to the oil industry. They equally argued that no matter the resolutions and clauses of training of manpower and the claim of permanent sovereignty, if there is no conscious development of indigenous technology, technology transfer cannot be achieved.</string>
    <string name="pettech11">\n<b>The Nigeria Oil and Gas Content Development Act 2010</b></string>
    <string name="pettech12"><b>(The Nigeria Content Policy)</b></string>
    <string name="pettech13"> This policy generally seeks to increase indigenous participation by prescribing the use of local services as well as to promote the employment of Nigerian staff in the oil industry. The policy is to the effect that every equipment manufacturing, repairs and maintenance shall be carried out in Nigeria.</string>
    <string name="pettech14">\nThe major purpose of the Nigeria content policy is to promote the local economy, increase local participation, build local capacity and provide domestic job growth to Nigerians. When the content policy was signed in 2010 by President Goodluck Jonathan, it was expected that five years after, it would generate over thirty thousand (30,000) jobs for Nigerians thereby reducing the rate of unemployment in the country</string>
    <string name="pettech15">\n The content policy was also strictly followed by major directives issued to all oil companies to the effect:</string>
    <string name="pettech16">1. That engineering design for all projects is to be domicile in Nigeria;</string>
    <string name="pettech17">\n2. That all operators and project promoters must list out items required for projects and operational activities and submit same to the Nigerian Content Division, an arm of the NNPC, before 31st January every year;</string>
    <string name="pettech18"> \n3. That forthwith, fabrication of all important oil and gas tools are to be done in Nigeria;</string>
    <string name="pettech19">\n4. That the assembling, testing and commissioning of the well heads and other systems should also be done in Nigeria;</string>
    <string name="pettech20">\n5. That certification of welding procedures must be carried out in Nigeria. Also that Nigerian Institute of Welding must certify all such test in collaboration with international accreditation companies;</string>
    <string name="pettech21"> \n6. That all oil operators must make provision for training and study programmes for Nigerians which shall lead to the use of Nigeria personnel in all areas of their oil operation.</string>
    <string name="pettech22">\n<b>The Nigeria Content Monitoring Board</b></string>
    <string name="pettech23"> The Nigeria Content Monitoring Board was established to address the lacuna discovered in the Nigeria content directive. The board was strictly to implement the provisions of the law. Operators in the Nigeria oil industry is required to submit to the board a Nigeria content plan in bidding for license or permit before carrying out any project. The plan must also show the operator intention to use locally manufactured goods where such goods meet the specification of the industry.</string>
    <string name="pettech24">\nThe policy of the Act requires that before the carrying out of projects in Nigeria, an operator is expected to establish a project office in the particular area it intends to execute the project. The policy of the Act also stipulates that employment and training of Nigerians must be given first consideration in any project executed by any operator</string>
    <string name="pettech25">\nAlso the Act stipulates that the insurance of all insurable risks must be conducted by an insurance company registered in Nigeria. Operators must also retain the legal services of a Nigeria law firm which must have an office in Nigeria. Also, operators are to regularly submit to the board a plan of legal services showing breakdown of legal services used together with a list of external solicitors.

    <string name="backtort">Historical Background Of Tort</string>
    <string name="backtort1"><b>Tort defined</b></string>
    <string name="backtort2">It is imperative to mention from the outset that there is no universally acceptable definition of the subject of law of torts. In other words, the concept of tort does not lend itself to a precise definition. Just like in many other concepts, there are varied definitions of the concept of tort</string>
    <string name="backtort3">\nKodilinye and Aluko in their book “The Nigerian Law of Torts” opined thus: “A tort may be defined broadly as a civil wrong involving a breach of duty fixed by the law, such duty being owed to persons generally and its breach being redressible primarily by an action for damages.”</string>
    <string name="backtort4">\nProf. Sir John W. Salmond defined tort as: “A civil wrong for which the remedy is a common law action for unliquidated damages, and which is not exclusively the breach of contract or the breach of trust or other merely equitable obligation</string>
    <string name="backtort5">\n<b>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF TORTS</b></string>
    <string name="backtort6">The word „tort‟ is derived from the Latin word tortus, which means „twisted‟. It came to mean „wrong‟ and it is still so used in French: „J‟ai tort‟; „I am wrong.‟ The word “tort” means “wrong”. The evolution of the law of tort has been somewhat haphazard and it is an area of law which is still developing</string>
    <string name="backtort7">\nThe early history of tort is contained in two strands of cases. One involved the negligent performance of an undertaking, calling, or office between parties who were in a prior relationship. This kind of case was in the common law for centuries. The second strand involved parties who were not in a prior relationship. The plaintiff\'s action was based on the defendant\'s failure to guard against foreseeable injury. Although examples can be found earlier, this kind of case primarily emerged in the last quarter of the seventeenth century</string>
    <string name="backtort8">\nIt is difficult to distinguish between tort and contract cases into the eighteenth century because the basis of the plaintiff\'s action and the defendant\'s liability in many cases of tort and contract was the latter\'s misfeasance, or failure to perform his undertaking with requisite care or skill. As early as 1374, a defendant\'s liability in assumpsit was predicated on his failure to act with the care or skill the community expected of him. For example, in one case, a surgeon was held liable for negligently treating a patient. The surgeon not only failed to cure the plaintiff\'s wounded hand, he actually made it worse. Explaining the rule of decision by analogy, Chief Justice Cavendish declared: “If a farrier undertakes to heal my horse, and by his negligence or failure to cure it within a reasonable time the horse is made worse, it is right that he should be held guilty. But if he does all he can, or puts all his diligence into the cure, it is not right that he should be held guilty, even though the horse is not healed. There is a great difference between the two cases.</string>
    <string name="backtort9">\nThe common law held common carriers of goods liable as insurers of safe delivery, it did not impose such a strict standard of liability on passenger carriers for the safety of passengers. This seemingly anomalous distinction made sense in light of the theory of tort liability. Common carriers of goods were held liable as insurers because goods were inanimate objects over which the owner completely lost control, and the carrier acquired exclusive control, when the owner delivered them to the carrier. Consequently, the common law held carriers of goods strictly liable for safe delivery to prevent them from defrauding shippers by pretending that they were lost or stolen, and to remove the difficult problems of proof confronting shippers who were forced to rely on carriers for evidence showing the cause of loss or damage.</string>
    <string name="backtort10"> \nPassengers, on the other hand, are not inanimate. While on the carrier, they can care for themselves, "exercising that vigilance and foresight, in the maintenance of their rights, which the owners of goods cannot do, who have entrusted them to others." Moreover, because they have volition, passengers, unlike inanimate objects, can bring about their injuries by their own actions. To hold a carrier strictly liable for an injury caused by the passenger was considered unjust and was not permitted by law. Consequently, contributory negligence was a bar to passenger recovery. Nonetheless, if a carrier\'s negligence created a dangerous situation and alarmed passengers, courts were lenient in determining whether the passengers\' behaviour in the circumstances was reasonable.
</string>
    <string name="distintort">Torts distinguished from other wrongs</string>
    <string name="distintort1">It is important to distinguish between torts and other branches of law. The dividing line between tort and other civil wrongs is thin. Furthermore, tort runs through the whole law. Like crime, a tort may occur in any other area of law. Attempt is made to compare tort with some other laws such as Tort and Contract, Torts and Crime, Tort and Trust, etc.</string>
    <string name="distintort2">\n<b>Tort and Contract</b></string>
    <string name="distintort3">Contract is an agreement between two or more parties which the law will enforce or recognise as affecting the legal rights and duties of the parties. However, tort is a breach of duty imposed by law. The main distinction between tort and contract is that in tort the duties of the parties are usually not duties which they expressly agreed upon but obligations primarily fixed by law, whereas in contract, the duties owed by contracting parties are obligations placed by the parties themselves as part of the terms of the contract. In other words, while contractual duties arise from agreement between the parties; tortuous duties on the other hand are created by operation of law independently of the consent of the parties.</string>
    <string name="distintort4">\nHowever, where damage is contractual, any breach of agreement between the two parties can only be remedied by a claim for a breach of contract. This view was affirmed by the Supreme Court in <i>Quo Vadis Hotel Ltd. v. Nigerian Maritime Service Ltd. [1992] 6 NWLR (Pt. 250) 253 at 664 SC.</i></string>
    <string name="distintort5">\nThe main object of legal proceedings in both contract and tort is damages. That is monetary compensation and or a grant of other appropriate remedy to the injured party for the injury or loss occasioned to him by a breach of contract or commission of a tort</string>
    <string name="distintort6">\n<b>Tort and Crime</b></string>
    <string name="distintort7"> A crime is an act or omission punishable by the state, while tort on the other hand consists of an act or omission by the defendant which causes damage to the claimant. The damage must be occasioned by the fault of the defendant and must be the kind of harm recognised as attracting legal liability. This is because it is not every harm that is recognised by the law as legal injury. The aim of the law of crime is to protect the interest of the public at large by bringing criminals to justice generally by means of imprisonment, cane or payment of fine. On the other hand, the purpose of tort is not to punish but to compensate the plaintiff who has suffered loss as a result of the defendant‟s wrongful conduct. When a person commits a crime, the state through the instrumentality of the police initiate criminal proceedings against him. Accordingly, the state takes the responsibility of taking criminal action. However, in the case of tort, it is the private individual. That is, the aggrieved party bears the cost of the proceedings.</string>
    <string name="distintort8">\nAnother distinction between crime and tort is that the former (crime) is essentially regulated by statute  while the latter (tort) is governed by judicial precedent</string>
    <string name="distintort9">\nWhile tort belongs to the province of civil law, crime on the other hand falls within the province of public law.</string>
    <string name="distintort10">\n<b>Legal effect of an action that is both tort and crime</b></string>
    <string name="distintort11"> Notwithstanding the differences enumerated above, it is pertinent to state that there are instances where an act may be both tort and crime, for example, criminal trespass, criminal libel, assault, false imprisonment, etc.</string>
    <string name="distintort12">\nHowever, where a tort is also a crime, the criminal standard of proof under the Evidence Act is what is also required in the civil trial. <i>Section 135(1) Evidence Act 2011</i> provides that if the commission of a crime be the party to any proceeding is directly in issue in any proceeding civil or criminal, it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt</string>
    <string name="distintort13">\n<b>Tort and Trust</b></string>
    <string name="distintort14">Both tort and trust are civil laws. The distinction between liability in tort and breach of trust is that of history. While tort is a common law origin, trust is a creation of equity. In other words, the law of tort arose or developed from common law, whilst the law of trust grew from the doctrine of equity in the Court of Chancery. In effect, the remedies of tort are mainly based on law, whilst the remedies of trust are originally equitable and discretionary. A trust arises in a situation where one or more persons hold property for the benefit of another person</string>
    <string name="distintort15">\n<b>Conclusion</b></string>
    <string name="distintort16">It is pertinent to mention that tort, crime, contract and trusts are not exclusive; a single conduct can give rise to liability in all these areas of law..
</string>
    <string name="tortpri">General principles of tortuous liability</string>
    <string name="tortpri1"><b>Damnum Sine Injuria – (damage without legal injury</b></string>
    <string name="tortpri2">It has been pointed out that not every action which causes harm is actionable as a tort. In some cases the act or omission of the defendant may have caused damage to the claimant but the claimant may have no action as the interest affected may not be one protected by law.</string>
    <string name="tortpri3">\nIt is a fundamental principle that damage is not actionable in tort unless such damage amounts to legal injury. Lawyers refer to this as damnum sine injuria, that is, harm without legal wrong. Damage without a legal wrong or damnum sine injuria is a loss or damage which does not have a legal remedy.</string>
    <string name="tortpri4">\nDamage without a legal injury is where a wrong or damage has been done to a person, nevertheless, the person has no right of action to recover compensation because no legal wrong has been committed. It is a damage suffered without the breach of a legal right.</string>
    <string name="tortpri5">\nIt must therefore be noted that it is not every harm suffered by a plaintiff that is actionable. This is in tandem with the Latin maxim deminimis non curat lex – meaning the law does not concern itself with trifles.e.g Trade Competition</string>
    <string name="tortpri6">\nAs a general rule of law, lawful use of property or lawful conduct without more is not a legal wrong against which right of action and remedy lies. However, when lawful use of property degenerates or graduates into nuisance or other legal wrong or breach of law, right of action and remedy then lies.</string>
    <string name="tortpri7">\n<b>Injuria Sine Damno – legal injury/wrong without damage</b></string>
    <string name="tortpri8">There are also cases where conduct is actionable even though no damage has been caused. This is known as injuria sine damno – legal injury without damage. Where a tort is actionable without proof of damage it is said to be actionable per se.</string>
    <string name="tortpri9">\nGenerally, the position of the law of tort is that the plaintiff is obliged to prove that he has suffered actual damage in respect of a particular act. However, there are aspects of torts that are actionable per se, that is, without proof of actual damage, injuria sine damno typifies such a case. Examples are trespass, which is actionable though no harm at all is caused to the person, land, or chattel</string>
    <string name="tortpri10">\nInjuria sine damno is the reverse of damnum sine injuria. Injuria sine damno literally means legal injury without damage. These involve cases in which the defendant‟s behaviour is actionable as a tort although it has not caused any harm at all to the plaintiff.</string>
    <string name="tortpri11"> \nAs a general rule, where there is a legal wrong without damage, the law presumes damage even though damage was not suffered by the plaintiff nor was proved by the plaintiff. For the simple reason that a legal wrong has been done to the plaintiff and the plaintiff is thereby entitled to an award of general damages, at least nominal damages, however small the amount. Examples of torts which are actionable per se, upon commission without the necessity of establishing damage include: Libel and sometimes slander, Trespass to the person, Trespass to chattels, Trespass to land, etc.</string>
    <string name="tortpri12">\nThe principle of legal wrong without damage (injuria sine damno), is an exception to the general rule that there must be damage or injury before legal action may be brought against a wrongdoer in tort. The torts in which damage need not be proved for a right of action to lie, are torts which are actionable per se, that is, they are actionable upon being committed.</string>
    <string name="tortpri13">\nTo succeed in a claim for compensation in torts that are actionable per se, the plaintiff only needs to prove on the basis of probability, that the tort he alleges was committed.
</string>
    <string name="tortclass">Classification of Torts</string>
    <string name="tortclass1">Torts may be classified according to the interest which they protect. This classification helps to know the relationship between various torts. Accordingly, torts may be grouped as follows as those that protect or concern:</string>
    <string name="tortclass2"> 1. Personal Interests</string>
    <string name="tortclass3"> \n2. Interference with judicial process</string>
    <string name="tortclass4">\n3. Property interests</string>
    <string name="tortclass5"> \n4. Interest in reputation</string>
    <string name="tortclass6"> \n5. Economic interests</string>
    <string name="tortclass7"> \n6. Interference with relationships; and</string>
    <string name="tortclass8">\n7. Miscellaneous interests</string>
    <string name="tortclass9">\n<b>Torts Protecting Personal Interests </b></string>
    <string name="tortclass10">   This means protection of the plaintiff from physical harm to his person. In other words, this type of tort protects a person or prohibits trespass to person. This tort includes the torts of trespass to the person (such as, assault, battery, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution), negligence, etc. These torts are concerned with protecting a person from being injured in the body. They also protect the freedom, liberty and dignity of a person from being denied by way of arrest, false imprisonment, etc.</string>
    <string name="tortclass11"> \nPeople have an interest in their personal security. This is protected in a number of ways. If one person puts another in fear of being hit, then there may be an action in the tort of assault. If the blow is struck, then the person hit may have an action in the tort of battery. A person whose freedom of movement is restricted unlawfully may be able to sue for false imprisonment. If personal injury is caused negligently, then the claimant may have an action in the tort of negligence.</string>
    <string name="tortclass12">\n<b>Torts Protecting Property Interests</b></string>
    <string name="tortclass13">Property in the broad sense of the word is protected by tort law. This tort is concerned with the protection of the plaintiff against interference with his property or rights over property. The torts that protect interests in property include trespass to chattels, trespass to land, nuisance, conversion, detinue, negligence (such as where clothing or a car is damaged in a negligently caused accident, then a person may have an action for damages in negligence), interests in intellectual property, such as, copyright, injurious falsehood, patents, trademark, etc. These torts protect the proprietary interests of a person.</string>
    <string name="tortclass14">\n<b>Torts Protecting Interests in Reputation </b> </string>
    <string name="tortclass15">This means the protection of the plaintiff‟s reputation in the society. The tort that protects the reputation of a person is the tort of defamation. Where a person‟s reputation is damaged by untrue speech or writing, then he may have an action in the tort of defamation. The law of defamation which is divided into libel and slander protects a person‟s right to his good reputation. It deals with wrongs to reputation. Defamation is also a crime. In criminal law, defamation consists of slander and libel.</string>
    <string name="tortclass16">\n<b>Torts Protecting Economic Interests</b></string>
    <string name="tortclass17"> Tort law will give protection to economic interests where the defendant has acted unlawfully and has caused economic loss to the claimant. These are known as the economic torts. Such protection is however limited because the common law has been cautious in drawing the line between lawful and unlawful business practice.</string>
    <string name="tortclass18">\nThis is a line which is largely left to statute to draw. The torts which protect economic interests include; deceit, passing off, vicarious liability, interference with contractual relations and inducing breach of contract, malicious or injurious falsehood, conspiracy, intimidation, occupier‟s liability, etc. These torts protect the economic interests of a person, such as economic relations and trading interests. They protect the right of a person to be free from financial or economic harm.</string>
    <string name="tortclass19">\n<b>Torts Prohibiting Interference with Judicial Process</b></string>
    <string name="tortclass20">The torts that prohibit interference with judicial process include malicious prosecution. This tort aims to protect persons against criminal prosecution without lawful excuse.</string>
    <string name="tortclass21"><b>Torts Prohibiting Interference with Relationships</b></string>
    <string name="tortclass22">The torts which protect relationship between one person and another person include interference with contractual relations, enticement and harbouring, etc. The torts of enticement and harbouring are old common law torts which protect the matrimonial rights of married persons; for instance the right of one spouse not to be denied the consort of the other spouse by a third party.</string>
    <string name="tortclass23">\nOn the other hand, the law of tort cares about economic and contractual relationships. For instance, the law of tort protects one contracting party from being denied the service of the other contracting party through inducement by a third party to break the agreement.</string>
    <string name="tortclass24"> \n<b>Torts Protecting Miscellaneous Interests</b></string>
    <string name="tortclass25"> This group of torts covers other multifarious and less common interests which are protected by the law of torts.
</string>
    <string name="trespassp">Trespass to Person</string>
    <string name="trespassp1"><b>Introduction</b></string>
    <string name="trespassp2"> Trespass to person is any intentional interference with the body of another person. It is interference with the body of another person or his liberty. It is an invasion of the body of another person. Trespass to the person consists of three types of tort. Trespass to person is an interesting aspect of the law of tort that seeks to protect the body or liability of a person from unlawful interference therewith.</string>
    <string name="trespassp3">\nTrespass to person consists of three aspects;</string>
    <string name="trespassp4"> 1. Assault – putting a person in fear of bodily harm</string>
    <string name="trespassp5">\n2. Battery - any contact, touch, force or bodily harm</string>
    <string name="trespassp6">\n3. False Imprisonment – deprivation of personal liberty or movement, any unlawful detention, or arrest</string>
    <string name="trespassp7">\nThe distinction between assault and battery is not difficult to draw; the heart of the tort of assault is putting the plaintiff in a climate of fear of imminent battery. On the other hand, battery consists of actually causing/bringing force or contact to bear on the person of the plaintiff. Battery is the intentional application of force to another person without lawful justification. Assault on the other hand is the intentional putting of another person in fear or apprehension of imminent battery or in fear of bodily harm.</string>
    <string name="trespassp8">\n<b>ASSAULT</b></string>
    <string name="trespassp9">This is an unjustifiable threat of force sufficient to arouse a well-founded apprehension of immediate harm. Any attempt by a person to strike the person of another but misses the target is sufficient to constitute an assault.</string>
    <string name="trespassp10">\nIn popular language, the word assault is used to describe the application of physical force to the person of another. However, in the law of tort, assault and battery are two different and separate torts. As a matter of fact, the actual application of force to the person is not an assault but a battery. In Nigeria under the Criminal Code Act the word assault is often used to cover both assault and battery. <i>Section 252 CC</i> defines assault to include both an application of force and a threat or attempt to apply force.</string>
    <string name="trespassp11">\nIt is assault for the police to order a person out of his car at gun point. This was demonstrated in the case of <i>FBN Plc v. Okonugha [2005] 16 NWLR (Pt. 950) 120</i></string>
    <string name="trespassp12">\nAn act which causes a reasonable man to apprehend battery is assault. Thus, in Genner v. Sparks (1705) 6 Mod 173, assault was defined as; “An attempt with force or violence, to do a corporal injury to another, as by holding up a fist in a menacing manner, striking at another with a cane or stick, although the party striking may miss his aim; drawing a sword or bayonet; throwing a bottle of glass with intent to wound or strike; pointing a gun at a person who is within the distance to which the gun will carry...”</string>
    <string name="trespassp13">\nAs a general rule, words alone, that is, mere words do not constitute assault. There may be exception to this rule however. To amount to an assault, the intention to apply force to the plaintiff must be shown by some action, or gesture, however slight or subtle and not just in words or speech. Therefore the intent to do violence must be expressed in threatening act not merely in threatening speech. In the case of <i>R. v. Maede and Belt (1823) 1 Lewin 184</i> the defendants surrounded the victim‟s house singing threatening and menacing songs, it was held that no assault was committed. Holroyd J stated thus “no words or singing are equivalent to an assault.”</string>
    <string name="trespassp14">\nIt is the law that mere passive obstruction does not constitute an assault. In <i>Innes v Wylie (1844) 174 ER 800</i>, the defendant policeman who stood motionless in order to block a door way, was held not to have committed assault on the plaintiff by so doing. The court contended that mere passive obstruction does not constitute an assault although if the plaintiff is thereby hindered from going about lawful occasion, he may use reasonable force by way of self help.</string>
    <string name="trespassp15">\nWhere a threat is impossible of being carried out there may be no assault. Accordingly, where a threat is clearly impossible of being carried out, there is no assault.</string>
    <string name="trespassp16">\n<b>BATTERY</b></string>
    <string name="trespassp17">Battery is the intentional or negligent application of force to the person of another or the making of physical contact with any part of the body of the plaintiff without lawful justification. The least touching of another in anger amounts to battery. According to C.F. Padfield, battery is: "applying force however slight to the person of another, hostilely or against his will.” And according to Gilbert Kodilinye: "battery is the intentional application of force to another person.”</string>
    <string name="trespassp18">\nIn <i>Cole v. Tuner (1704) 19 E.R. 958</i>, Holt CJ held "that the least touching of another in anger is battery.” To touch another person in anger, though in the slightest degree or under pretence of passing is a battery.</string>
    <string name="trespassp19">High level of force or any touching may constitute battery. Malemi on Torts highlight different ways in which battery may be committed viz;</string>
    <string name="trespassp20"> 1. Beating with a stick, pouring water on a person, or shooting a person with a gun.</string>
    <string name="trespassp21"> \n2. Knocking a person down, or running a person down with a motor vehicle.</string>
    <string name="trespassp22">\n3. Spitting on a person\'s face as held in <i>R v Lynsey (1995) 3 All ER 654 CA </i> or throwing stone at a person.</string>
    <string name="trespassp23"> \n4. Removing a chair from under a person who thereby falls to the ground.</string>
    <string name="trespassp24">\n5. Pulling a person away from something for his own good.</string>
    <string name="trespassp25">\n6. Setting a dog to attack a person, etc.</string>
    <string name="trespassp26">\n<b>Battery and Medical Consent</b></string>
    <string name="trespassp27"> In the medical field it is common knowledge that patients and medical practitioners including health workers often come in contact with one another. Although consent is sometimes implied, yet it behoves on the medical personnel to seek the informed consent of patient before treatment. It has become clear with a few exceptions, that it is the duty of a medical practitioner to obtain the consent of a patient before embarking on the treatment of such patient. The only exception to this is where the patient falls within either of the two categories of being a minor or a person of unsound mind.</string>
    <string name="trespassp28">\nIf a patient refuses to give informed consent, the law is that the medical practitioner who proceeds to administer the medical measure or treatment, surgery or blood transfusion, would be liable for assault and battery. He could be liable even where no injury is occasioned, since trespass is actionable per se.See <i>Sidaway v. Board of Governors Bethlehem Royal Hospital (1985) 2 WLR 480 at 488.</i></string>
    <string name="trespassp29">\nIt is important to mention that an adult of full understanding has an absolute right to the inviolability to his body. He has the unfettered right whether or not to consent to medical treatment even if the treatment is necessary to save his life.</string>
    <string name="trespassp30">\nIn the case of a pregnant woman, she has the right to choose treatment for her unborn child. In the same light an adult of full capacity has the right to choose whether to eat or not even if the refusal is tantamount to suicide, as in the case of hunger strike he cannot be compelled to eat.</string>
    <string name="trespassp31">\n<b>FALSE IMPRISONMENT</b></string>
    <string name="trespassp32">According to some learned authors (like Kodilinye and Aluko), false imprisonment is a misleading term. Ordinarily, the word “false” normally means „fallacious‟ or „untrue‟. But in tort it means wrongful or unlawful imprisonment. Imprisonment usually means locking a person in jail, but in tort it has a wider meaning as it includes not only incarceration in prison but any physical restraint of a person without the consent of the claimant or without lawful justification.</string>
    <string name="trespassp33">\n<b>Lack of knowledge of imprisonment on the part of the plaintiff at the material time</b></string>
    <string name="trespassp34"> It is not necessary for the person who is restrained to know at the material time that he was detained, restrained, confined, or being prevented from leaving. In other words, it is immaterial that the person who was being imprisoned was unaware that he was being imprisoned at the material time. It is sufficient if he is informed of the false imprisonment later. Thus, a person may be falsely imprisoned while unconscious, asleep, or otherwise unaware and so forth. The person need not be aware so long as the false imprisonment is a fact or complete. If he learns about it from another person, he is entitled to sue.See <i>Meering v Graham White Aviation Company Ltd. (1920) 122 LT 44,</i></string>
    <string name="trespassp35">\nTo succeed in an action for false imprisonment, it is important that the restraint is total. A partial restraint is not sufficient. Therefore, to bar a person from going in three directions, but leaving him free to go in a fourth direction is not false imprisonment as he has not been in a situation of total restraint.See <i>Bird v. Jones (1845) 7 QB 742; 115 ER 668</i></string>
    <string name="trespassp36">\n<b>Who is liable, the police or the caller of the police?</b></string>
    <string name="trespassp37"> A person may be liable for false imprisonment if he himself effected the arrest. The general rule that he who instigates another person to commit a tort is a joint tortfeasor for procuring or actively promoting the commission of a tort. In deciding who may be sued for false imprisonment, the deciding factor is "who was active in promoting and causing” the arrest? Therefore, a person may be liable for false imprisonment by effecting the arrest or confinement personally, or by instigating another person to commit the tort.See <i>Payin &amp; Azele v. Aliuah &amp; Agyile (1953) 14 WACA 267</i></string>
    <string name="trespassp38">\n<b>Mere Words May Not Amount To False Imprisonment</b></string>
    <string name="trespassp39">Generally, mere words without more do not constitute false imprisonment. In <i>Genner v Sparkes (1704) 91 ER 74</i>, the defendant/court bailiff informed the plaintiff that he had come to arrest him. The plaintiff who was holding a pitch fork used it to prevent the bailiff from reaching him, while he ran into his house without the defendant trying to hold him. In a claim by the plaintiff, the court held: that there was no false imprisonment, as mere words in the absence of any other act, such as, attempt to hold, or immobilise the plaintiff, could not amount to false imprisonment.</string>
    <string name="trespassp40">\n<b>Use of law enforcement agents to recover debts</b></string>
    <string name="trespassp41"> Odigie on Torts note that the frequent use of law enforcement agents to recover debt is unlawful. Accordingly, where the person detained did not commit a crime and he is arrested by a police officer, the police officer would be liable for false imprisonment. The plaintiff has the option of suing both the complainant and the police together, jointly and severally for damages for unlawful arrest and false imprisonment. See <i>McLaren v. Jennings [1997] 3 NWLR (Pt.493) 333,</i></string>
    <string name="trespassp42">\n<b>Defences to Trespass to Person</b></string>
    <string name="trespassp43">The defence to an action for trespass to person includes:</string>
    <string name="trespassp44">1.	Self Defence or Justification: under common law, a person has the right to self defence. The only requirement for successful plea of self defence is that the defence should be reasonable or appropriate. This includes self defence or the defence of another person especially where a person is morally or legally under obligation to protect another person.</string>
    <string name="trespassp45">\n2.	Defence of property; a person may commit commensurate or reasonable trespass to person, such as assault, battery or false imprisonment in order to protect his property or the property of another person which he has a moral or legal obligation to protect.</string>
    <string name="trespassp46">\n3.	Consent: if a person consents to being physically contacted then there is no tort of battery. This is expressed in the maxim “volenti non fit injuria” – meaning no injury is done to he who consents. Consent may be given by words or may be implied.</string>
    <string name="trespassp47">\n4.	Necessity: a wrongdoer can have a successful defence if he can show that it was necessary to act in the way he did.</string>
    <string name="trespassp48">\n5.	Judicial Authority: a court of competent jurisdiction has an absolute power to enforce his order, warrant of arrest and prison sentence.</string>
    <string name="trespassp49">\n6.	Lawful Arrest: the police has a wide power under the Criminal Code Act to stop, search, or to arrest a person whom they reasonably suspect of having committed a crime or may be carrying  stolen or prohibited items</string>
    <string name="trespassp50">\n7.Statutory or Lawful Authority: a person may be exonerated from criminal liability under the tort of trespass to person where he does so in the interest of the society and in accordance with the law of the land</string>
    <string name="trespassp51">\n8.	Parental Authority: A parent or guardian in loco parentis of a child may lawfully chastise or confine the child and would not be liable for battery, assault or false imprisonment provided that the amount of force used or the detention is reasonable in the circumstances</string>
    <string name="trespassp52">\n9.	School Authority: a school teacher having charge of a child has a right to discipline the child by way of reasonable chastisement or confinement.</string>
    <string name="trespassp53">\n10.	Captain of a Ship or Aircraft: the captain of a ship or an aircraft is responsible to maintain order for the safety of the trip. He may, therefore, exercise such authority as is necessary to preserve life and property in the course of the journey.
</string>
    <string name="trespassl">Trespass to land</string>
    <string name="trespassl1">Trespass to land means doing anything that is offensive to one‟s land. Within its legal connotation, trespass to land refers to wrongful interference with or invasion on one‟s possession of land. It is wrongful if it is done without the consent of the owner of the land. In <i>Mohammed Madumma v. Jambo [2001] 15 NWLR (Pt. 736) 461</i>, trespass to land was described as the unjustifiable intrusion by one person upon land in possession of another, and it is actionable at the instance of the person in possession. One of the ingredients to establishing a case of trespass to land is that the intrusion or interference must be without the consent of the person in possession who must have indicated same. Another ingredient here is that the trespasser must have shown some unwillingness to vacate the land in question.</string>
    <string name="trespassl2">Trespass to land could be committed by any of the following ways or methods:</string>
    <string name="trespassl3">1. By directly entering or walking on one‟s land without authorization</string>
    <string name="trespassl4">\n2. By placing or projecting any object in the land in the possession of the claimant</string>
    <string name="trespassl5">\n3. By going into the building on the land without the owner‟s consent, permission or authority</string>
    <string name="trespassl6"> \n4. By cultivating in the land</string>
    <string name="trespassl7">\n 5. By throwing things such as water on the adjoining land</string>
    <string name="trespassl8">\n6. By exceeding the extent of duration of the permission granted. That is, by remaining on the land after the right to enter has ceased, or by abusing the right of entry.</string>
    <string name="trespassl9">\n7. By allowing cattle to stray into another‟s land</string>
    <string name="trespassl10">\n<b>Ways of Asserting or Proving Possession</b></string>
    <string name="trespassl11">The owner of a land can proof that he has been in peaceable enjoyment of the land to the exclusion of all other persons. This is known as exclusive possession. All that the plaintiff needs to prove is that he has exclusive possession, or a right to such possession of the land in dispute. Exclusive possession does not mean physical presence on the land. Possession to land can be proved when any of the flowing methods are present:</string>
    <string name="trespassl12"> 1. By planting or cultivating on the land</string>
    <string name="trespassl13"> \n2. By erecting a building or fence on the land</string>
    <string name="trespassl14"> \n3. By demarcating the land with pegs or survey beacons at its corners.</string>
    <string name="trespassl15">\n4. By possession through a third party, e.g. servant, agent, tenant. By extension, a tenant is also a person in possession and could maintain an action for trespass.</string>
    <string name="trespassl16">\n<b>Proof of ownership to Land</b></string>
    <string name="trespassl17">Ownership to land can be proved by any of the following ways:</string>
    <string name="trespassl18">1.	By giving traditional evidence: the plaintiff should be able to relate the traditional history of the land, such as that he paid the owner of the land in the presence of witnesses and that the owner of the land put him into possession of the land. Where the plaintiff‟s title is predicated on inheritance, he must satisfactorily articulate the line and sequence of inheritance through traditional evidence to establish</string>
    <string name="trespassl19">\n2.	Proof of acts of ownership: this includes possession and enjoyment of the land. The owner can proof that he has been in peaceable enjoyment of the land to the exclusion of all other persons. This is known as exclusive possession. All that the plaintiff needs to prove is that he has exclusive possession, or a right to such possession of the land in dispute.</string>
    <string name="trespassl20">\n3.	Proof by document of title: the owner can prove his ownership of the land by presenting the deed of transfer or Certificate of Occupancy</string>
    <string name="trespassl21">\n4.	 Proof of acts of long possession: a claim in trespass is rooted in exclusive possession. A plaintiff can maintain action in trespass to land by proving that he has being in possession of the land for a long period.</string>
    <string name="trespassl22">\n5.	Proof of possession of adjoining land: this can be done by mentioning names or even calling in evidence as witnesses boundary men (neighbours). This mode of establishing title was given judicial approval by the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division in the case of <i>Kashidayi v. Noma [2000] 15 NWLR (Pt. 692) 807.</i></string>
    <string name="trespassl23">\nWhen a person successfully establish his title to land, he could be entitled to damages for trespass already committed, and a relief of injunction against further act of trespass. This was the view of the Supreme Court in the case of <i>Olorunfemi v. Asho [1991] 1 NWLR (Pt. 585) 1 at 9</i>, when it held that in a claim for damages for trespass and an injunction to restrain further trespass, once there is a finding of trespass, the claims for damages and injunction must be awarded.</string>
    <string name="trespassl24">\nA claim for damages for trespass is not dependent on that of declaration of title. In trespass the issue for determination is whether the plaintiff has established actual and exclusive possession of the land. This was the crux in <i>Balogun v. Agbesanwa [2001] 17 NWLR (Pt. 741) 118</i> where a grantee challenged the title of his grantor, he incurs the penalty of forfeiture.</string>
    <string name="trespassl25">\nIt was also held in <i>Christopher Okolo v. Eunice Uzoka (1978) 4 SC 77</i> that where a plaintiff successfully establishes possession against a trespasser, the court is enjoined to grant an order of injunction to protect such possessory right.</string>
    <string name="trespassl26">\n<b>Reliefs</b></string>
    <string name="trespassl27">The reliefs available to a claimant in an action for trespass to land include the following:</string>
    <string name="trespassl28">1.	An order of injunction: an injunction is a specific order of court against a party, mandating him to do, or restraining him from doing a particular act, in respect of which the cause of action arose between the parties. The primary purpose of injunction is to protect the applicant against injury, real or threatened, to his right which would not otherwise be adequately compensated in damages.</string>
    <string name="trespassl29">\n2.	Warding off a trespasser: a land owner in peaceful possession is entitled to ward off interference with such possession with the use of reasonable force in the retention of possession of the disputed land. Therefore, the proposition that extra-judicial measure cannot be used to recover possession of land is not an inflexible rule.<i> Ofodile v. C.O.P. Anambra State [2001] 3 NWLR (Pt. 699) 139.</i></string>
    <string name="trespassl30">\n3.	Declaration of title: when a party successfully establishes title to a land in dispute, he is entitled to a declaratory relief from the court. By this, he is declared the rightful owner of the parcel of land. Consequently, whatever improvements might have been made on the land automatically cedes to the successful party by virtue of the principle of quic quid platatur solo solo cedit, which literally means “whatever is on the land forms part of the land”. It is irrelevant that the party who lost has expended money in developing the land.</string>
    <string name="trespassl31">\n4.	Recovery of possession: when the plaintiff eventually succeeds, he takes possession over everything on the land. It is pertinent to mention that a plaintiff who specifically asks to be put in possession cannot succeed in the award of damages at the same time. This is because both reliefs are inconsistent with each other and mutually different in intents and purposes. Trespass shows the fact of plaintiff‟s possession, while the claim for recovery of possession presupposes that the plaintiff is out of possession, and wants to be put back in possession.
</string>
    <string name="trespassc">Trespass to chattel</string>
    <string name="trespassc1"><b>Introduction</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc2">   The two torts of trespass to chattels: conversion and detinue protect the possessor of a chattel from wrongful interference therewith. It is important to state from the outset that each tort overlaps with the others at several points, conversion and detinue cannot therefore be regarded as two watertight compartments. These two forms of trespass to chattel are each actionable per se upon commission or occurrence without the plaintiff having to prove any physical or actual damage.</string>
    <string name="trespassc3"> \nThe torts of Conversion and Detinue are torts that can be committed against property. These torts share so many similarities, with very little differences that are only discernible on a closer look. This is perhaps the very reason why some countries, especially in Europe, including the United Kingdom, decided to amend their laws and merged the two torts together.</string>
    <string name="trespassc4">\n<b>What is a chattel?</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc5"> The word "chattel" means any article, goods, or personal property, other than land and immoveable property. Examples of chattel or goods are innumerable. A chattel is any moveable thing which is capable of being owned, possessed, or controlled other than a human being, land and immoveable property. Examples of chattel include cars, furniture, animal, vessel, aircraft, and anything whatsoever which is moveable and capable of being owned. Indeed, the list of chattels cannot be exhausted.</string>
    <string name="trespassc6">\nKodilinye and Aluko in their book “The Nigerian Law of Torts” define trespass to chattel as a direct and wrongful interference with a chattel in the possession of the plaintiff, such interference being either intentional of negligent. In effect, a person commits trespass to goods when he directly and without lawful justification interferes without justification with the goods in the possession of another person.</string>
    <string name="trespassc7">\nAlthough, trespass to chattel is actionable per se, however it is not a strict liability tort. Originally, it was a tort of strict liability, and it was unnecessary for the claimant to prove that the defendant‟s act was intentional or negligent. However, the modern rule is that either intention or negligence must be established, but there is no liability for an interference with goods which is merely accidental. See <i>National Coal Board v. Evans (1951) 2 KB 861</i></string>
    <string name="trespassc8">\nTrespass to chattels may take various forms such as destroying, damaging or merely using goods or wrongfully moving them from one place to another. In <i>Kirk v. Gergory (1876) 1 Ex D. 55; (1976) 34 LT 488</i>, the mere moving of chattels (rings) belonging to a man who had just died from one room to another was held to be trespass to chattels and nominal damages was awarded against the defendant.</string>
    <string name="trespassc9">\nTrespass to chattel may be committed in many different ways. Examples of trespass to chattel include: Taking a chattel away, throwing another person\'s property away, such as in annoyance, mere moving of the goods from one place to another, that is, mere asportation, scratching or making marks on the body of the chattel, or writing with finger in the dust on the body of a motor vehicle, killing another person\'s animal, feeding poison to it or beating it, destruction, or any act of harm or damage etc</string>
    <string name="trespassc10">\n<b>The Persons Who May Sue For Trespass to Chattel</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc11">Anyone who has possession or caretakership of a chattel may sue any other person who meddles with the chattel. This is so for the object of the tort of trespass is to protect possession, or the right to immediate possession. So for a person to bring an action for trespass to goods, he must have been in possession of the goods at the material time of the interference. In other words, anyone who has possession or right to immediate possession can sue. Possession and not ownership is what the law requires here. Hence it is immaterial that the plaintiff is not the owner of the chattel. Accordingly, some persons who do not have legal right are deemed by law to have possession, so that they will be able to protect chattels left under their care.</string>
    <string name="trespassc12">\nThe tort of trespass to chattel is designed to protect possession, that is, the right of immediate possession of a chattel against interference by another person without lawful justification, as distinct from ownership.</string>
    <string name="trespassc13">\n<b>Conversion</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc14">The tort of Conversion is only one of the torts that can be committed against property. The tort of Conversion means dealing with someone‟s property in a manner that is inconsistent with the right of the owner. An owner in this context refers not only to the true owner but also to someone in possession without necessarily being the true owner of the goods converted. The tort of Conversion can also be described as an unlawful interference with, or usurpation of another‟s possessory right or interest in goods.</string>
    <string name="trespassc15">\nAccording to Sir John Salmond, in his book the Law of Tort, 21st ed. (1996) p. 97-98: "A conversion is an act... of wilful interference, without lawful justification, with any chattel in a manner inconsistent with the right of another, whereby that other is deprived of the use and possession of it”.</string>
    <string name="trespassc16"> \nConversion is any interference, possession or disposition of the property of another person, as if it is one\'s own without legal justification.</string>
    <string name="trespassc17">\nConversion is any dealing which denies a person of the title, possession, or use of his chattel. It is the assertion of a right that is inconsistent with the rights of the person who has title, possession or right to use the chattel. It is dealing with a chattel which belongs to another person in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights of the person</string>
    <string name="trespassc18">\nThe tort of Conversion was judicially defined in the case of <i>Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway Co v. Mc Nicolle (1919) 88 LJ K.B. 601</i> to mean dealing with goods in a manner inconsistent with the rights of the true owner provided ...there is an intention on the part of the defendant in so doing, to deny the owner‟s right or to assert a right which is inconsistent with the owner‟s right.”</string>
    <string name="trespassc19">\n<b>Differences between Conversion and Trespass</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc20"> From the above judicial definitions of conversion, it can be clearly seen that any form of dealing with the property of another in such a way that it will deny the owner or any person in possession, or having right of immediate possession of the goods or chattels constitutes conversion and is actionable. This is not the same as the tort of trespass to chattel which can be committed by merely moving the property of another from one place to another even without taking it away or trying to deny the owner or any person in possession of the goods or chattels or his right. Conversion is different from trespass to chattels in other respects. In conversion, the conduct of the defendant must deprive the owners of the possession of the chattel, or amount to a denial or dispute of the title of the owner, whereas, any form of interference with the goods of another which is direct and immediate amounts to trespass to chattel.</string>
    <string name="trespassc21">\n<b>Methods of committing the tort of Conversion</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc22"> Conversion of a chattel, belonging to another person may be committed in many different ways. Examples of conversion include:</string>
    <string name="trespassc23">\n1. Conversion by Taking</string>
    <string name="trespassc24">\n2. Conversion by Using</string>
    <string name="trespassc25">\n3. Conversion by Alteration</string>
    <string name="trespassc26">\n4. Conversion by Destruction, Consumption or Alteration</string>
    <string name="trespassc27"> \n5. Conversion by Receiving 6. Conversion by Detention</string>
    <string name="trespassc28">\n6. Conversion by Wrongful delivery or Misdelivery by a Carrier</string>
    <string name="trespassc29">\n<b>Conversion by Taking</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc30">This occurs where a defendant takes a plaintiffs chattel out of the plaintiff s possession without lawful justification with the intent of exercising dominion over the goods permanently or even temporarily.</string>
    <string name="trespassc31">\n<b>Conversion by Using</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc32">This occurs where the defendant uses the plaintiff‟s chattels without the latter‟s permission. Mere use without permission, even without taking away the plaintiff‟s chattel or goods can be conversion</string>
    <string name="trespassc33">\n<b>Conversion by Destruction, Consumption or Alteration</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc34"> Conversion by destruction occurs where the defendant wilfully cause damage to the plaintiff‟s chattel such a setting a plaintiff‟s clothes ablaze. Where the defendant exposes the plaintiff‟s goods to the risk of destruction he will also be liable for conversion.</string>
    <string name="trespassc35"> \nConversion by consumption occurs where the defendant without the permission of the plaintiff consumes or eats up the latter‟s goods.</string>
    <string name="trespassc36">\nConversion by alteration is when the defendant intentionally and without the plaintiff‟s permission obliterates or changes the form of the plaintiff‟s goods.</string>
    <string name="trespassc37">\n<b>Conversion by Receiving</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc38">This occurs where the defendant knowingly receives property of the plaintiff transferred to him by a third party who is not the owner. This will amount to conversion. This is wrongful, for it is an act of assisting the other person in the conversion of the chattel, or the receiving of stolen goods.</string>
    <string name="trespassc39">\n<b>Conversion by Wrongful Disposition or Transfer of Title</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc40"> This form of conversion occurs where the defendant takes the plaintiff‟s chattel and sells it out rightly. The defendant would be held liable for conversion in such a circumstance. At common law, conversion is committed by a person who bought and took delivery of goods from a seller who has no title to the chattel or right to sell them. Such as when a thief, steals and sells a chattel.</string>
    <string name="trespassc41">\n<b>Conversion by Detention</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc42">This occurs where the defendant who is in possession of the plaintiff‟s chattel without authority, refuses to surrender it to the plaintiff when asked to do so by the owner or other person having immediate right of possession. In this type of conversion, the defendant often comes into possession of the goods without lawful authority and there is usually an unconditional demand for the return of the same but the defendant who has acquired wrongful possession would have failed to do so.</string>
    <string name="trespassc43">\n<b>Conversion by Misdelivery or Wrongful Delivery to a Carrier</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc44"> This type of conversion occurs where a carrier or a warehouse man wrongfully delivers goods to a person other than the person to whom it is meant. The carrier or warehouse man would be liable irrespective of whether he did it by mistake or innocently.</string>
    <string name="trespassc45">\n<b>DETINUE</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc46">The word detinue is a French word meaning to hold back. It is a common law action where a person (the plaintiff), having an absolute right in the goods seeks to recover it from another who is in actual possession and that other person refuses to deliver them up upon such demand. In other words, detinue is the wrongful detention or retention of a chattel whereby the person entitled to it is denied the possession or use of it.</string>
    <string name="trespassc47">\nAll bases of liability under the tort of detinue have now been incorporated into the tort of conversion by virtue of<i> Torts (Interference with Goods) Act of 1977</i>. Section 2(1) &amp; (2) of the Act provides:</string>
    <string name="trespassc48">\n(1) Detinue is abolished</string>
    <string name="trespassc49"> \n(2) An action lies in conversion for loss or destruction of goods which a bailee allowed to happen in breach of his duty to his bailor</string>
    <string name="trespassc50">\nBy the above provision detinue is no longer a tort in England; even instances which before 1977 would have been detinue, such as in the case of bailor-bailee relationship, have now been subsumed under the tort of conversion. This is in contradistinction in Nigeria where detinue is still considered a separate tort. In fact, recent court decisions show that Nigeria court still recognise these torts as not the same notwithstanding the fact that both torts are intertwine especially the tort of conversion by detention and detinue which would have been the reason behind its abolition in England. Even recent judicial pronouncements and definitions of the tort of detinue are similar to the definition of conversion by detention which in England would have been conversion.</string>
    <string name="trespassc51">\nThe ingredients of the tort of detinue as outlined by the Supreme Court of Nigeria in the case of <i>N.A.C.B. v. Achagwa [2010] 11 NWLR (Pt. 1205) 339 at 366</i>, can still qualify as conversion by detention. The ingredients are that:</string>
    <string name="trespassc52"> \na. The person suing must be the owner of the property (goods or chattel)</string>
    <string name="trespassc53"> \nb. The plaintiff demanded for the release</string>
    <string name="trespassc54">\nc. The defendant refused pr neglected to release the property (moveable property).</string>
    <string name="trespassc55">\nFrom the foregoing, it is clear that there is no clear difference between the torts of conversion and detinue</string>
    <string name="trespassc56">\n<b>Difference between the Torts of Conversion and Detinue</b></string>
    <string name="trespassc57">1.	The defendant will not be liable for conversion by detention where, prior to the demand for their return by the plaintiff, the good have been lost or destroyed, whether by accident or by the negligence of the defendant. But the defendant will be liable in detinue in such circumstances.</string>
    <string name="trespassc58">\n2.	Refusal to deliver according to the learned author is the essence of detinue. This assertion can be faulted on the ground that refusal to deliver is also the essence of conversion by detention.</string>
    <string name="trespassc59">\n3.	In detinue the plaintiff can claim specific restitution of the goods but cannot do so in conversion. This assertion can be argued on the ground that the plaintiff can also claim same in conversion if the goods were not destroyed.</string>
    <string name="trespassc60">\n4.	In conversion, damages are generally assessed on the value of the goods at the date of the conversion, whereas in detinue they are assessed on the value of the goods at the date of the trial</string>
    <string name="trespassc61">\n5.	According to Dennis Odigie, a claim for conversion is an action in persona, which if successfully prosecuted, culminates in judgment for a single sum for the value of the chattel as in the case of Ihenacho v. Uzochukwu [1997] 2 NWLR (Pt. 487) 257. On the other hand, a claim for detinue is an action in rem, which entitles a successful plaintiff to an order of specific restitution of the chattel, or in default, payment of its value and damages for its detention.
</string>
    <string name="negli">Negligence</string>
    <string name="negli1"><b>Introduction</b></string>
    <string name="negli2"> Negligence in torts means omission to do something which the law places on a person to do. In other words, negligence is the breach of a legal duty to take care which result in damage undesired by the defendant to the plaintiff. Negligence is a tort which enjoins a party to exercise due care in his action, such that harm does not result to another from such action.</string>
    <string name="negli3">\n<b>Standard of Care</b></string>
    <string name="negli4">Standard of care is a concept of negligence which enjoins every person on whom a duty of care is place to conduct his activities in such a manner that the duty of care is not breached. Negligence is conduct falling below the standard established for the protection of others against unreasonable risk or harm. The test for this standard is normally objective.</string>
    <string name="negli5">\n<b>The Requirement of Proof and Duty of care</b></string>
    <string name="negli6">Duty of care is the duty that the law places on individuals to be exercised such that harm does not result to others by his action. In an action for negligence, the law requires strict proof of damages, that is to say, specific damage must be proved strictly and this may depend on the circumstances under which the act was committed. Once damage is proved to the satisfaction of the court, the plaintiff is entitled to damages which is awarded though at the discretion of the court, but would not award special damages unless there is cogent compelling and ascertainable evidence, mostly in a form of documentary evidence</string>
    <string name="negli7">\nIt is a question of law whether in a given situation a duty of care exists. A duty of care may be imposed by statutes. However, the most basic criterion used by the courts to determine the existence of a duty is that of a reasonably foreseability, as was formulated in the locus classicus of <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i>. This principle that reasonable foreseability is the basic criterion for the existence of duty is, however, not absolute; it is qualified by one important factor – policy.</string>
    <string name="negli8">\nIt is pertinent to mention that even when the defendant admits liability in negligence, it is still important for the plaintiff to particularize and prove the specific claims. Where the plaintiff fails to do so, he can only be entitled to special damages. See <i>Consolidated Breweries Plc v. Aisowieren [2005] 15 NWLR (Pt. 736) 424</i></string>
    <string name="negli9">\nIn a case of negligence, it is irrelevant that the defendant admitted liability in negligence. The defendant may admit negligence and at the same time raise a claim of contributory negligence. When the claim of contributory negligence is raised, the defendant is in effect saying that the plaintiff‟s injuries were partly a result of his own (plaintiff‟s) negligence. The defendant in such a situation acknowledged that his conduct had not lived up to that standard of the hypothetical reasonable and prudent man, but that the plaintiff would not have been injured or if injured at all, such injuries would have been minimal if he (the plaintiff) had behaved carefully.</string>
    <string name="negli10">\n<b>Duty of Care and Road Users</b></string>
    <string name="negli11"> Every person who uses the road by operating on it any type of vehicle, or mechanically propelled object has a duty to do so with due care and attention to other road users, and due regard to the condition of the road at any given time</string>
    <string name="negli12">\nIn <i>Ohehen v. State [1998] 1 ACLR 568</i>, Ighodaro J, stated: “It is the duty of the owner or driver of a car in a high way to use reasonable care to avoid injuring the users of the high way. The duty of care varies with the time and place. At a time when there are many people on the road, it is his duty to go at a speed no matter how slow, so that he can easily pull up and not run over pedestrians.</string>
    <string name="negli13">\n<b>Duty of Care and Pedestrians</b></string>
    <string name="negli14"> The law is that pedestrians owe a duty to be vigilant while crossing the road, and to ensure that they do not endanger their lives. Failure to meet this requirement leaves them without a remedy, in the event of accident. See <i>Okoli v. Nwagu (1960) 5 FSC 16</i></string>
    <string name="negli15">\n<b>Duty of Care and Road Construction Companies</b></string>
    <string name="negli16"> A contractor engaged in the construction of a road, or public way, owes a duty to the road users to exercise the requisite duty of care, so as to prevent economic loss in the form of loss of lives, or damage to property. In this respect, the construction company would be liable for any damage suffered by any road user, where heaps of sand or other construction materials are left on the road unlighted or unprotected, or without warning signals on around them. This assertion received legal affirmation in the case of <i>Julius Berger (Nig) Ltd. v. Ede [2003] 8 NWLR (Pt. 823) 526.</i></string>
    <string name="negli17">\nWhere there is an unlighted obstruction on the roadway, a motorist plying the road at night time or other time when visibility is impaired who sustains injury by reason of such obstruction will recover damages against the person who cause it. This principle applies equally to owners of broken down vehicles on the high way.</string>
    <string name="negli18">\n<b>Duty of Care and Carriage by Rail</b></string>
    <string name="negli19">Railway operators are under a duty to ensure that reasonable care and precautionary measures are taken to ensure that pedestrians and motorists are adequately warned of the inherent danger attendant to crossing the line. Such measures include the use of whistles, and level crossing barricades. A notice of “Beware of Trains” has been held not to be enough safeguard. See <i>Nigeria Railway Corporation v. Emegaara [1994] 2 NWLR (Pt. 325) 206</i></string>
    <string name="negli20">\nThe same principle applies to liability of carriers by rail on the issue of loss of passengers‟ luggage.</string>
    <string name="negli21">\n<b>Duty of Care and Air Carriage</b></string>
    <string name="negli22"> Airline operators are under a duty to ensure that passengers are flown to their destinations safely. Operators must ensure that airlines are airworthy at all times. Failure to meet this standard attracts liability. See <i>Nigeria Airways v. Abe [1988] 4 NWLR (Pt. 90) 523</i></string>
    <string name="negli23">\n<b>Duty of Care and Carriage by Water</b></string>
    <string name="negli24">The duty of care owed passengers by ship owners was recognised and given its pride of place as far back as the 19th century. In the words of Lord Justice Vaughan Williams: “The statute (Merchant Shipping Act 1894) must be held to impose on ship owners an implied condition to carry steerage passengers with reasonable care, and provision to the contrary is inconsistent with this implied condition.” This duty of care was demonstrated in the case of <i>Davie v. New Merton Board Mills Ltd. (1959) A.C. 604</i>.</string>
    <string name="negli25">\n<b>Duty of Care and Hotel Operators</b></string>
    <string name="negli26"> The hotelier or operator of recreation centres or a place of leisure is liable for the loss of goods kept within the premises of the hotel. The hospitium includes the swimming pool arena, open field, parking lot and the rooms within the entire premises. In <i>William v. Linnett (1951) 1 All E.R. 278</i>, Lord Tucker said: “If an innkeeper holds himself out as willing to receive customers‟ motor cars on his premises, he is responsible for their safety.</string>
    <string name="negli27">\n<b>Employer’s Duty to Employee</b></string>
    <string name="negli28"> The owner of an enterprise and their appointed agents, usually the managers of the workplace has the responsibility for managing employees safety. In occupations that involve risk, the employer has a duty to provide competent staff, adequate material, appropriate safety gadgets and equipment, proper system and effective supervision. At common law, an employer has a duty to provide safe work environment for his employees. This is important in order to reduce the incidence of risk, industrial accident and exposure to occupational hazard, which often sometimes result in severe bodily injury or permanent disability. Failure by the employer to provide an enabling environment for the worker to perform his duty amounts to a breach of duty of care by the employer.</string>
    <string name="negli29">\nIn the case of <i>Nolan v. Dental Manufacturing Co. Ltd (1958) 1 WLR 936</i>, a workman was blinded while sharpening a tool for grinder, when a chip flew into his eye. His employer was held liable for failure to provide strict orders on the use of the tool, and also, for failure to provide plaintiff with goggles.</string>
    <string name="negli30">\n<b>Manufacturers of Consumer Goods</b></string>
    <string name="negli31"> \nA manufacturer is under a duty to avoid putting into the overt market, consumer goods that are unfit for its purpose, or which would result in injury to consumers in the course of use due to defect. See <i>Constance Ngonadi v. Nigerian Bottling Company Ltd [1985] 1 NWLR (Pt. 4) 739</i></string>
    <string name="negli32">\n<b>Doctor and Patients</b></string>
    <string name="negli33">Where a medical doctor works as an employee to a hospital and he discharges his duty professionally, he is not told how to discharge such duty, he would be liable for any damage resulting from his negligence act in that capacity. See <i>University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital v. Mrs Theresa Akilo [2001] 4 NWLR (Pt. 703) 246</i></string>
    <string name="negli34">\nIt is evident that Nigerian courts require a high standard of proof against doctor who for any reason leaves foreign object in the body of patient during surgical operation, on account of negligence. The patient is further disabled from relying on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur where the doctor or any other doctor proffers explanation for the presence of such foreign object in the patient‟s body. Where the patient desires to rely on the evidence of another medical practitioner to prove negligence against his surgeon, it is unlikely that a medical doctor would be willing to testify against a professional colleague to establish negligence or lack of diligence in the discharge of his duty in his capacity as a medical practitioner.</string>
    <string name="negli35">\n<b>Architects and Builders</b></string>
    <string name="negli36">The standard or duty of care expected of architects and building contractors is higher than that expected of other professionals.See <i>Clay v. Crump and Sons Ltd. (1964) 1 QB 533</i>.</string>
    <string name="negli37">\n<b>Skill and Judgment</b></string>
    <string name="negli38"> A person is liable for any injury suffered by another as a result of the misleading statement made to the victim when the circumstances require reliance on the skill and judgment of the tortfeasor. See Nidogas Company Ltd v. Augusco Nigeria Ltd [2001] 16 NWLR (Pt. 739) 268.</string>
    <string name="negli39">\n<b>The Doctrine of Res Ipsa Loquitur</b></string>
    <string name="negli40">The doctrine of Res Ipsa Loquitur which literarily means “the fact or thing speaks for itself” is a legal principle applied by the court in civil litigation to lighten the burden of proof ordinarily expected to be met by the plaintiff, by shifting a part of the burden to the defendant. The common law doctrine has been variously defined by learned authors and jurists.</string>
    <string name="negli41">\nIn <i>Orajekwe v. Mbieri (1965) 159 E.R. 665</i>, the Supreme Court stated: “The doctrine arises where in an accident a thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servant and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if the person who has the management of the thing used proper care, and where it afford a reasonable evidence in the absence of explanation by the defendant that the accident arose from want of care.”</string>
    <string name="negli42">\n<b>Res ipsa loquitur and adulterated drinks</b></string>
    <string name="negli43">A manufacturer of consumer goods is under a duty to avoid putting into the overt market, consumer goods that are unfit for human consumption or which would result in injury to consumers in the course of use. As a rule, the simultaneous application of the doctrine and consideration of particulars of negligence in the adjudication process is incongruous, both being strange bed fellows. Consequently, each must be place on separate and parallel tracks by the trial court while appraising the facts and circumstances of the case before him. See <i>Okonkwo v. Guinness Nigeria Ltd</i></string>
    <string name="negli44">\n<b>MODE OF PLEA</b></string>
    <string name="negli45">\nThere are no hard and fast rules relating to the mode or pattern of plea of the doctrine of Res Ipsa Loquitur. Consequently, the doctrine need not be pleaded with the maxim. Where it is done it amounts to superfluity. It is sufficient if the particulars of negligence given reasonably show that plaintiff is relying on the doctrine; or if it is pleaded as part of the facts of negligence; or in the alternative either by using the Latin maxim itself; or by making it known that the plaintiff intends to rely on the circumstances of the accident itself as evidence of negligence.</string>
    <string name="negli46">\n<b>DEFENCES TO THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE</b></string>
    <string name="negli47">\n<b>Remoteness of Damages</b></string>
    <string name="negli48">It is not sufficient for the claimant top establish a causal connection between the act of the defendant and the damage. It is also necessary to establish that the damage was not too remote. This is a matter of law, and legal principles have been formulated to determine the question of remoteness. In <i>Wagon Mound (Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd v. Mersey Dock Engineering Company Ltd (1961) A.C. 388</i></string>
    <string name="negli49">\n<b>Volenti Non Fit Injuria</b></string>
    <string name="negli50">Where is it evident that a person voluntarily assumes a risk, he cannot complain about the adverse effect of that risk on him. He is deemed to have submitted to the situation he finds himself. See <i>Ratcliffe v. McConnel (1998) The Times, 3 December</i></string>
    <string name="negli51">\nA man who loses his sense of self control and consumes alcohol beyond the level of his physiological tolerance is deemed to have consented to the likely effect of being drunk</string>
    <string name="negli52">\n<b>Contributory Negligence</b></string>
    <string name="negli53">This is the apportionment of blame and damages to both parties. It is usually shared among the parties on percentage basis. The burden of proving contributory negligence against the plaintiff rests on the defendant. However, this may be inferred from the plaintiff‟s own evidence or on balance of probabilities from the facts.</string>
    <string name="negli54">\n<b>But for Test</b></string>
    <string name="negli55"> Certain events occur which could have been averted but for the happening of another event. If the damage would not have occurred but for the defendant‟s tortuous conduct, then the defendant is liable.</string>
    <string name="negli56">\n<b>Novus Actus Intervieniens</b></string>
    <string name="negli57">Where the defendant‟s negligent forms part of a sequence of events leading to harm to the plaintiff and the act of another person (without which the damage would not have occurred) intervenes between the defendant‟s negligence and damage, the court must decide whether the defendant remains responsible or whether the act can be regarded as breaking the chain of causation between the negligent act and the damage</string>
    <string name="negli58">\n<b>REMEDIES</b></string>
    <string name="negli59">Damages are pecuniary compensation obtainable by success in an action for a wrong which is either a tort or breach of contract, the compensation being the form of a lump sum. In negligence, the measure of damage is that the injured party is to be placed back as far as money can do it, in the same position as he would have been, had it not been for defendant‟s negligence.
</string>
    <string name="occupy">Occupier‟s liability</string>
    <string name="occupy1">Occupier‟s liability is the liability which the occupier of a premises bears in respect of loss or injury suffered by those who lawfully come upon his premises. The term “occupier” in legal parlance simply means a person who has sufficient degree of control over premises to put him under a duty of care towards those who lawfully come to such premises. Premises in the context of tort include fixed or moveable structures, vessels, vehicles or aircraft.</string>
    <string name="occupy2">\nThe English Occupiers Liability Act of 1957 and 1984 embodied statutory duties. Under the 1957 Act, the duty was restricted only to lawful visitors, but extended to non-visitors under the 1984 Act.</string>
    <string name="occupy3">\nThe duty owed by the occupier under the Occupiers Liability Act of 1957 relates only to dangers arising from the condition of the premises, not the activities carried on the premises.</string>
    <string name="occupy4">\nUnder the 1957 Occupiers Liability Act of England, the interest of trespasser was not taken into consideration. At common law, the occupier was only liable to trespasser in respect of wilful act done by the occupier in disregard of the presence of the trespasser. However, the 1984 Occupiers Liability Act of England brought succour to trespassers who were hitherto neglected by the 1957 Act</string>
    <string name="occupy5">\n<b>Liability of Hotel Management</b></string>
    <string name="occupy6">A common law duty exist to ensure that hotels are reasonably safe apart from the duty owed by the hotelier as an occupier under the Occupiers Liability Act of 1957 to visitors to the hotels.</string>
    <string name="occupy7">\nIn England, the applicable statutes are the Occupiers Liability Act of 1957 and 1984. In Nigeria the applicable statute to the torts of occupiers liability is the Law Reform (Tort Law) Cap. 115 Law of Lagos State 1994, Law of the Defunct Bendel State 1976 – applicable in Edo and Delta.</string>
    <string name="occupy8">\nGenerally, an occupier owes a duty to trespassers. A trespasser is a person whose presence on the land is unknown to the occupier, or if known, objected to by the occupier in some practical way. An occupier is not liable to any injury sustained by a person who incurs such injuries in the exercise of his professional calling.See General Cleaning Contractors Ltd v. Christmas (1952) 1 K.B. 141</string>
    <string name="occupy9">\n<b>Undertaking by Service Providers as to Safety of Goods</b></string>
    <string name="occupy10">Where an occupier who renders services to lawful visitors provides a place for user‟s bags, umbrellas and other personal effect, and issues discs or tally, to such users as they drop these items, it is assume that the authority had undertaken the care and custody of such items as bailee, with a promise to return same to the owner. It is immaterial that the owners of the personal effects did not pay for such undertaking and failure to return the items attracts liability. See Broadline Enterprises Ltd v. Monterey Maritime Corporation [1995] 9 NWLR (Pt. 417) 1</string>
    <string name="occupy11">\nHowever, where the occupier places conspicuous exemption notices, such as “property at owner‟s risk” on the shelves where bags and other personal effects are kept, the authority would likely escape liability, even where it issues discs to owners of such items. This is the current position of the law as decided by the Supreme Court in Anyah v. Imo Concorde Hotels Ltd.</string>
    <string name="occupy12">\n<b>Duty of Care and Carriage by Rail</b></string>
    <string name="occupy13">Railway operators are under a duty to ensure that reasonable care and precautionary measures are taken to ensure that pedestrians and motorists are adequately warned of the inherent danger attendant to crossing the line. Such measures include the use of whistles, and level crossing barricades. A notice of “Beware of Trains” has been held not to be enough safeguard. See Nigeria Railway Corporation v. Emegaara &amp; Sons</string>
    <string name="occupy14">\nThe same principle applies to liability of carriers by rail on the issue of loss of passengers‟ luggage</string>
    <string name="occupy15">\n<b>Duty of Care and Hotel Operators</b></string>
    <string name="occupy16">Guests at hotels are regarded as lawful visitors and therefore are owed common duty of care so long as they use the parts that guests are ordinarily expected to use. Such parts include the lounge, reception, public rooms, restaurant, bedroom and conveniences. Guests will ceased to be lawful visitors if they entered parts of the premises not ordinarily meant of their use, such as kitchen, laundry, offices as they are trespassers to these parts since they do not have permission to enter upon any of them. As long as he remains a lawful visitor, the hotel operators owe him common duty of care. Thus, in the case of <i>Hill Station Hotel Ltd. v. S.B. Adeyi</i></string>
    <string name="occupy17">\n<b>Library Authorities</b></string>
    <string name="occupy18">Library authorities owe a duty of care to all persons who lawfully enter their premises. In this regard, the occupier must ensure that the premises are reasonably safe. In <i>Ward v. Tesco Stores Ltd (1976) 1 All E.R. 219</i>, it was held that the defendant and their servants owed a duty to see that the floor of the store were kept clean and free from spillages, so that accidents did not occur.</string>
    <string name="occupy19">\nLibrary operators owe a duty to ensure that the floor of the library is safe and conducive for library users. A library with slippery floor tiles, falling ceilings, filthy toilets and poor lighting system is obviously unsafe for users. The golden rule is that visitors are guaranteed reasonable safety in the use of library remises for the purpose for which they are permitted by the occupier.</string>
    <string name="occupy20">\n<b>Injuries to Children</b></string>
    <string name="occupy21">Where obvious danger is perceived by the occupier, the law requires him to exercise a higher duty of care towards children, beyond placing warning signals to that effect. In Pannet v. McGuiness (1972) 3 All E.R. 137, a five year old child was playing on a building site where advertising boards were burnt. The child had been warned several times, along with other children to stay away. It was held that this did not absolve the defendant of liability as the defendant knew of the presence of children on the building, and could have taken steps to prevent the accident.
    \n<b>Defences</b>
    \nA defendant can avail himself of any of these defences where an injury occurs to a visitor or an invitee to his premises. These defences include:
    \n1.	Act of God: if an injury is caused by factors which are clearly attributable to nature and without human intervention, the occupier of that premises would not be liable to the injured party.\n
   \n2.	Act of a Stranger: a stranger cannot be an occupier within the meaning ascribed to it by the English Occupier‟s Liability Act. Therefore, any mishap which is traceable to the stranger would not impose liability on the occupier of that premises.\n
    \n3.	Act of an Independent Contractor: an independent contractor is a person who is told what to do, but not how to carry out the execution; that is to say, the position differs from that of the mater/servant.\n
    \n4.	Volenti Non Fit Injuria: occupiers do not owe a duty to visitors in respect of risks willingly accepted by them. In <i>Simms v. Leigh Rugby Football Club Ltd (1969) 2 All E.R. 923</i>, it was held that a professional rugby player had accepted the risk of playing on a rugby ground that complied with bye-laws of the Rugby League\n
    \n5.	Contributory Negligence: the ordinary principle of contributory negligence also applies to occupier‟s liability. The apportionment of blame and liability became vividly recognised with the enactment of the <i>Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945.</i> Section 1(1) of the Act provides thus “where any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such an extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant‟s share in the responsibility for the damage.”

    <string name="nuis">Nuisance</string>
    <string name="nuis1"><b>Introduction </b>
    \nNuisance is the indirect interference with crops, lands, and the use and enjoyment of land which does not belong to the user. It is a tort arising from a condition or activity created by a person which unduly interferes with the use and enjoyment of the land of another.\n
    \n<b>Definitions of Nuisance</b>
    \nIn Samouris v. Maja [1997] 7 NWLR (Pt. 460) 336, Uwaifo, JCA (as he then was) defined nuisance as “a tort arising from a condition or activity which unduly interferes with the use and enjoyment of the land of another. It is an act or omission which is an interference with, disturbance of, or annoyance to a person in the exercise or engagement of a right. It can manifest in the form of noise, vibration, smoke, fume, smell, pollution, flooding, fire, etc.”\n
    \nThe law of nuisance is essentially predicated on the Latin maxim “sic utere tuo alienum non laedas” – meaning “so use your own property as not to injure your neighbours”\n
        \n<b>The Law on Nuisance</b>
    \n Although nuisance is a common law concept, provision is made for it by some local legislation. <i>Section 251 of the Tort Law of Anambra State of Nigeria</i> describes the concept of nuisance as follows: “A person who does an act or makes an omission or otherwise creates a condition which unduly interferes with another person‟s use or enjoyment of the land, or of a right over or interest in land shall subject to this part of this law be liable to such other person for a civil wrong known as nuisance.”\n
    \n<b>Factors for Determining Private Nuisance</b>\n
    \n<b>Nature of Locality</b>
    \nThe nature of the locality where the nuisance takes place is a major factor to be considered in ascertaining whether or not an act constitutes a nuisance. This is against the backdrop of the fact that the type of commercial activity that goes on in a place is largely determined by that locality. The standard of conduct and comfort protected by the law for a community varies from place to place.\n
    \n<b>Noisy Environment</b> \nA dweller in city centre is not expected to have an environment that is completely free of noise, smoke, or smell. In other words, he is expected to cope with a measure of such disturbances.<i>Abiola v. Ijoma (1970) 2 ALL NLR 268</i>\n
    \n<b>Who can sue?</b>
    \nAny person who is aggrieved can sue in nuisance. Although, prior to the enactment of the 1979 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (CFRN), public nuisance was essentially recognised as a form of crime in respect of which only the Attorney General could initiate proceedings against offenders. Where a private individual sought to enforce public right, he needed to obtain a fiat from the Attorney General. Unless this condition precedent was complied with, the individual had no locus standi to institute such action, albeit, private nuisance was within the competence of the victim (i.e. a private litigant). This point was put in proper perspective in <i>Adediran v. Interland Transport Ltd [1991] 9 NWLR (Pt. 59) 18</i>, where Belgore JSC stated that while private nuisance is within the competence of the victim to prosecute civilly, public nuisance is a criminal matter for prosecution by the Attorney General.\n
    \n<b>Post 1979 Constitution</b>
    \nAs stated earlier, before the enactment of the 1979 CFRN, public nuisance was essentially recognised as a form of crime in respect of which only the Attorney General could initiate proceedings against offenders. However, with the enactment of the 1979 CFRN, the limitation which hitherto existed under Common law as to who has the right to bring an action in public nuisance lost its significance in Nigeria. By virtue of section 6(6) (b) 1979 CFRN (impari materia with section 6(6) (b) CFRN 1999 as amended), the court is now vested with the judicial powers extending to all matters between persons, or between government or authority and to any persons in Nigeria, and to all actions and proceedings relating thereto, for the determination of any question as to the civil rights and obligations of that person.\n
    \n<b>Who can be sued?</b>
    \n The person to be sued in nuisance is the occupier of the property from which the nuisance emanates or the person who creates the nuisance. The general rule is that a landlord is not liable for nuisance committed by his tenant. To this general rule, there is an exception which is to the effect that the landlord is liable if he has authorized his tenant to commit the nuisance.\n
    \n<b>Types of Nuisance</b>
    \nBasically, there are two types of nuisance, viz; private nuisance and public nuisance. Whereas private nuisance is within the competence of the victim to prosecute civilly, public nuisance is a criminal matter for prosecution by the Attorney General.” It is apposite to mention that the distinction between private and public nuisance having been rendered obsolete by the 1979 Constitution is now only relevant for the purpose of ascertaining when an Attorney General can sue on behalf of the public in respect of particular nuisance.\n
        \n<b>Public Nuisance</b>
    \nPublic nuisance is committed where a person carries on some harmful activities which affect the whole people or part of the people. In <i>S.P.D.C. Ltd v. Adamkue [2003] 1 NWLR (Pt. 832) 533</i>, the Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt Division, defined public nuisance as one which inflicts damage, injury or inconvenience on the generality of the population or upon a class of people who come within its ambit.\n
    \n<b>Computation of Damages in Public Nuisance</b>
    \nIn computing damages for public nuisance, the plaintiff is entitled to the market value of the goods destroyed at the time of destruction, consequential losses like incidental expenses, and loss of profit. In public nuisance, the measure of damages is the same as in torts generally. Where it is established that public nuisance has been committed and loss or injury is proved, the damages recoverable would be compensatory.\n
    \n<b>Private Nuisance</b>
    \nPrivate nuisance consists of continuous, unlawful and indirect interference with the use or enjoyment of land, or of some right over or in connection with the use of or enjoyment of land. This type of nuisance does not result in damage or inconvenience to the public at large, but simply interferes with an individual‟s use and enjoyment of land.\n
    \nIn <i>Airobuyi v. Nigerian &amp; Pipelines Ltd (1976) 6 UILR (Pt. 1) 1</i>, it was held that the defendant act of sand blasting operations which caused the plaintiff and his family to suffer from cold and catarrh from the resultant dust and smoke amounted to nuisance.\n
    \nIn <i>Fay v. Prentice (1845) 1 C.B. 828</i>, rain water was caused to fall on the plaintiff‟s land by a cornice projecting from the defendant‟s building and over-hanging the plaintiff‟s land. It was held to be nuisance, and injunction was granted.\n
        \n <b>Private and Public Nuisance Distinguished</b>
    \nAlthough the distinction between private and public nuisance in terms of locus standi has been laid to rest with the enactment of the 1979 Constitution, the distinction still exist clearly in terms of cause of action and ingredient of each of the torts.\n
    \nWhere the right of a person interfered with is a right belonging to him as a member of the public, such nuisance is a public nuisance. But where the right interfered with is the ownership or occupation of land or of some easement, profit, or other right used or enjoyed in connection with land, it is private nuisance. Public nuisance is one which inflicts damage, injury or inconvenience on the generality of the population or upon a class of people who come within its ambit. This was the definition offered by the Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt Division in the case of SPDC v. Adamkue .\n
    \nOn the other hand, private nuisance is a violation of a person‟s private right as opposed to the violation of a right which he enjoys as a member of the public.\n
    \n<b>Proof</b>
    \nIn an action for nuisance, proof of actual damage is essential, and the cause of action is limited to interference with one‟s possession. To maintain an action in private nuisance, one must have interest in the land which is adversely disturbed by the act of an immediate neighbour or a resident within the neighbourhood.\n
    \n<b>Nuisance and Trespass Compared</b>
    \nUnlike trespass to land which is concerned with direct interference with one‟s possession, nuisance is an indirect interference with one‟s interest or enjoyment of his land.\n
    \nIn an action for trespass, proof of actual damage is not necessary, whereas in an action for nuisance, proof of actual damage is essential. Put differently, to tort of trespass is actionable per se while on the other hand the tort of nuisance is not actionable per se.\n
    \n<b>Death of a Party in Nuisance</b>
    \nA claim in nuisance falls into the same category with that of trespass which if committed during the deceased party‟s lifetime remains an injury to the estate of the deceased, and therefore survives his death. In effect, an action in nuisance survives the death of the original litigant, and therefore cannot be regarded as a personal action which dies with either party to the suit.\n
    \n<b>Defences</b>\n
    \n 1) Reasonableness of His Act or Omission: A defendant may plead that alleged act of a nuisance was a normal or a reasonable act to be expected in that circumstance and in that community at that period in time and that there was no malice in the act complained against.\n
    \n 2) Statutory Authority: As a general rule, the fact that there is a valid permit by a Government Department is not a licence to commit nuisance. However, a land that has been earmarked for a purpose by statutory authority, carrying out such provision will be a defence under statutory authority, especially when the defendant is not negligent in doing just that\n
    \n 3) Act of God: Act of God may be a defence in some circumstances. A road that is carved in and cut into two after a heavy rain and flooding of the area may not be attributable to the contractor that constructed the road. This is because, the defendant can plead Act of God in that circumstance.\n
    \n 4) Act of a Stranger: An act of a stranger may be a good defence if it is shown that the defendant has taken steps to discontinue the effect of the strangers act immediately the act came to his knowledge.\n
    \n 5)Consent: Consent will be a defence if the defendant has acted within the terms of agreement and has been reasonable in his act.\n
    \nIt is important to mention that it is no defence that the best known means have been taken to reduce or prevent the noise complained of, or that the cause of the nuisance is the exercise of a business or trade in a reasonable and proper manner.\n
    \n<b>Remedies for Nuisance</b>
    \n 1. Damages: these are monetary award against a tortfeasor. Where a defendant leaves a piece of land overgrown with weeds in a residential area, he would be liable for any damage caused to neighbours property as a result of fire outbreak from such land overgrown with weeds.\n
    \n 2. Injunction: where the injury suffered by the plaintiff is a continuing one, the court will grant an injunction to abate its continuance. This may take the form of prohibitory injunction.\n
    \n 3. Abatement: where a court is satisfied that an action constitutes nuisance, an order for abatement can be granted.\n
    \n 4. Self Help: an owner of land has the right to abate a nuisance by looping the branches of trees which overhang his land or roof where no damage has resulted.</string>

    <string name="vicar">Vicarious Liability</string>
    <string name="vicar1">Vicarious liability is the damages borne by an employer for the wrong done by his employee to another person (third party). It simply means holding somebody else responsible for the misdeed of another person, and the person so held is someone who has control over the actual offender (tortfeasor).\n
\n <b>Requirements/Conditions for the Application of the Principle</b>
\n For a plaintiff to succeed in an action for liability against an employer for wrong done by his employee, the plaintiff must be aware of the fact, and be able to prove that the wrongdoer was at the material time acting on the order or influence or on behalf of the employer. In other words, it must always be proved that at the material time the employee was acting in the course of his employment.\n
\n <b>Prohibition of a servant from doing an act</b>
 \n The application of the principle is not restricted by the fact that a servant was prohibited from doing the act which resulted in the injury. In other words, the fact that a servant was prohibited from doing the act which resulted in the injury does not excuse the employer from liability for injury which results by the activity of the servant.\n
\n However, the application of the principle is restricted by plaintiff‟s knowledge of the fact that the defendant‟s servant was prohibited from doing the act which resulted in the injury, and yet fail to take steps to avoid the danger or injury.\n
\n <b>Scope of Authority</b>
\n Where a servant wrongly executes his master‟s authority, the master would be liable provided the wrong was committed in the course of duties or employment.<i>Union Bank v. Ajagu [1990] 1 NWLR (Pt. 126) 326</i>\n
\n <b>Principal – Agent Relationship</b>
\n The concept also applies to principal and agent relationship in agency. In other words, where an agent acts on behalf of the principal, the latter would be held liable for damage caused to the other person. See <i>Julius Berger (Nig) Ltd v. Ede [2003] 8 NWLR (Pt. 823) 526,</i>\n
\n <b>Motor Accident </b>
\n Where a person who is not a servant to the owner of a vehicle gets involved in accident while driving it, the owner would be liable to the injured party. This is because the person who drives a vehicle is presume to have the owner‟s express or implied authority to do so at all material time and therefore liable for any damage caused by the driver. See <i>Eseigbe v. Agholor [1987] 1 NWLR (Pt. 48) 172</i>\n
\n <b>Servant on a Frolic of his Own</b>
\n The law is that where a servant commits a tort while being on a frolic of his own, the employer would still be liable. When an employee executes an employer‟s instruction in a  way that is outside the specific instruction, it means that he has acted differently from the instruction but within the scope of his employment. Where a driver is specifically instructed to ply a particular route, the fact that he plied another route at the time of his involvement in an accident, or being on a frolic of his own would not mean that he has acted outside the scope of his employment\n
\n <b>Act Committed in the Course of Employment</b>
\n The law is that an employee is not personally liable for an act he performed on behalf of his employer within the scope of his authority. The question as to when an act is deemed to be committed in the course of employment was answered in <i>A.C.B. Nigeria Ltd v. Agugo  [1995] 6 NWLR (Pt. 599) 65</i>, where it was held that an act is deemed to be committed in the course of employment if:\n
\n (i) It was a wrongful act authorised by the master\n
\n (ii) The servant carried out an authorised instruction from the master in a wrongful and unauthorised manner.\n
\n The law that an employee is not personally liable for an act he performed on behalf of his employer within the scope of his authority was judicially affirmed in the case of <i>Julius Berger (Nig) Ltd v. Ede</i>\n
\n <b>Security Guard </b>
\n Where a security guard attached to an organization commits a tort, the organization would be held vicariously liable. See <i>First Bank of Nigeria Plc v. Onukwugha [2005] 16 NWLR (Pt. 950) 120</i>\n
\n As earlier stated, where an employee of an organization commits a tort, the organization would be held vicariously liable. Under such situation, it is immaterial that the defendant did not authorise the wrongful act. It is also irrelevant that the employee was not employed to undertake the specific function which resulted in the tort.\n
\n <b>Vicarious Liability as Between Husband and Wife Relationship</b>
\n The law is that a man cannot be vicariously liable for the wife‟s act and vice versa. This is especially where the wife or husband of the defendant was not driving the vehicle for the purpose or business of the defendant. For a plaintiff to succeed in an action for vicarious liability against a husband for the act of his wife and vice versa, the plaintiff must prove that the wife or husband of the defendant was driving the vehicle for the purpose or business of the defendant or that the defendant had interest in the journey and his wife or husband as the case may be was in the circumstances not his or her agent or servant. See <i>Ducland v. Ginoux &amp; Ginoux (1969) 1 All NLR 26</i> – where the wives of both plaintiff and defendant were involved in an accident in a car driven by the wife of the defendant. Held; husband not vicariously liable\n
\n <b>Corporate Bodies</b>
\n Although a company is not animate, it can commit tort through its servant or employee. The law is to the effect that a wrongful act done by an employee of a company is deemed to be done by the company, provided the tort was committed in the course of employee‟s employment. <i>Nigeria Airways v. Abe [1988] 4 NWLR (Pt. 90) 523</i>\n
\n Where the liability of the principal tortfeasor/employee is not established, the master/employer cannot be held liable\n
\n <b>Bank Employees </b>
\n The rule is that a bank is vicariously liable to a customer whose money is fraudulently withdrawn from his account by the bank employee. For this proposition, there is the case of <i>First Bank of Nigeria Ltd v. Owie [1997] 1 NWLR (Pt. 484) 744</i>.\n
    \n <b>The Implication of not Joining an Employee in an Action Arising from Tort Committed in the Course of Employment </b>
    \n The law is that a servant had to be joined as a party to the suit against his master before the relationship of master and servant can be established. The implication of not joining an employee in an action arising from tort committed in the course of employment is that the action would be deemed incompetent ab initio and the court would have no option but to throw it out. <i>Ifeanyichukwu Osundu Co. Ltd v. Soleh Boneh (Nig) Ltd</i>\n
    \n <b>Where a Servant Dies or Absconds</b>
    \n The law is that where servant dies or absconds, the aggrieved party can still proceed against the master. In this situation, the absence of the principal tortfeasor or servant will not be fatal to the plaintiff‟s action. In other words, where the servant dies in the accident, a plaintiff can still maintain an action against the employer. This rule was given judicial notification in the case of <i>Fanmilk Ltd v. Edemeroh [2000] 9 NWLR (Pt. 672) 402</i>\n
    \n <b>Where a Servant Fails to Defend Suit or Fails to Appeal against Judgment </b>
    \n The law is that where a servant fails to defend a suit filed against him and his master, or neglects to file an appeal against the judgment, the master would be precluded from taking steps to appeal against the judgment.\n
    \n <b>Liability in Maritime Cases</b>\n
    \n The general rule is that a disclosed principal is vicariously liable for the tortious act of his agent. However, under the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act No. 59 of 1991, liability is placed on the shoulder of an agent in maritime cases. Section 16(3) of the Act provides that “A person who acts as an agent of the owner, charterer, manager or operator of a ship may be personally liable irrespective of the liability of his principal for the act, default, omissions, or commission of the ship in respect of anything done in Nigeria”. Thus, an agent is liable for any act or omission committed by him against the interest of an innocent party, provided that tort was committed within the shores of Nigeria.\n
    \n<b> Liability in Agent/Principal Relationship</b>
    \n The law is that where a person delegates a task or duty to another who is not a servant but an agent, the person delegating the task would be vicariously liable for the negligence of that other person, if it is proved that the task was either for his own benefit or for the joint benefit of both of them. See <i>Trust Co. Ltd v. Da Silva (1956) 1 WLR 376. Parker v. Miller (1926) 42 T.L.R. 408</i>\n
    \n <b>Vicarious Liability and Independent Contractor </b>
    The law is that the employer of an independent contractor is not vicariously liable for the negligent act of the independent contractor. The common law position is that a person who employs the services of an independent contractor is not liable for the tort committed by that contractor while carrying out the duties for which he is employed. The main thrust for this position is that an independent contractor is presumably or most probably an expert in the job which he is employed to do. This golden rule was established in the locus classicus case of Quarman v. Burnett (1840) 6 M &amp; M 499 where it was explicitly stated that one who employs another is not liable for his collateral negligence unless the relationship of master and servant existed between them. This rule relieves a person who employs an independent contractor from liability and places such liability at the doorstep of the independent contractor.\n
    \n<b> Effect of the Public Officers Protection Act</b>
    \n The Public Officers Protection Act does not protect a person who acts maliciously. Where a servant acts maliciously in the course of his employment, the master would be held vicariously liable for any injury caused to another person by the act of such servant. Also, any defence raised by a defendant to defeat the claim of the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff did not commence his action in court within three months after the accident cannot be sustained.\n
    \n <b>Joint Tortfeasor</b>
    \n A joint tortfeasor is a person who can be held liable under established cause of action for an offence. He need not necessarily be the principal actor. He is a necessary party to the action. A joint tortfeasor is a person who needs to be joined as a defendant whenever the other defendants are to be held responsible in connection with the same tort. This is to say that the law imputes the commission of the same wrong or wrongful act of two or more persons at once\n
    \n<b> Exception to the Rule of Joint Tortfeasor</b>
    \n The master is joined to the servant because there is the necessity to establish the liability of the servant before attributing such liability to the master. However, where the offence bothers on crime, the master is not liable.\n
    \n<b> The Doctrine of Common Employment </b>
    \nThe doctrine operates for the purpose of exempting the master from liability. For the doctrine to operate, two conditions must be satisfied;\n
    \n1. The servants must be fellow-servants. This means that they must be in the service of common employer. In other words, both parties must be servants of the same master.\n
    \n2. They must be engaged in one common employment. That is to say, the work must be common, but it need not be identical.\n
    \n<b>Relief</b>
    \n Damages: where the liability of an employee or servant has been established and the plaintiff is able to establish the relationship between the servant and the master, the latter would be vicariously liable in damages for the injury caused by the former

    <string name="econtort1"> Economic torts arise from acts of unfair competition which are committed by rivals and unprincipled business outfits against genuine economic interest and the survival of similar business organisations which causes such business organisation to suffer detriment in terms of profit making and retention of goodwill. The major forms of economic torts include:
 \n 1. Passing off\n
\n 2. Deceit or fraud\n
\n 3. Injurious falsehood\n
\n <b>Passing off </b>
\n The law of passing off is concerned with unfair competition between traders. Passing off relates to the presentation of goods by imitators such that the unsuspecting consumer on a cursory look believes he is buying the genuine product.\n
\n Passing off as a tort is committed against a trade mark, trade name, brand name, get-up, labelling or design, packaging, pictorial representation or colouration, etc. As a matter of fact, once there is the possibility of deception, it is passing off.\n
\n <b>Ingredients of passing off</b>
\n To constitute a valid action for passing off, the following elements must be present, viz‟
\n 1. There must be a misrepresentation\n
\n 2. Such misrepresentation must be made by a trader in the normal course of business\n
\n 3. It must be directed at potential customers of the goods\n
\n 4. It must be calculated to injure the plaintiff‟s business or goodwill\n
\n 5. It must have caused some damage to plaintiff‟s business\n
\n <b>Passing off in Relation to Goods </b>
\n Passing off in relation to goods can be committed when an imitator presents his product of the same general description in terms of packing style, pictorial presentation, get-up or dominant syllables in a manner that is similar to that of the genuine product, such that the consumer viewing the imitation at a glance can hardly distinguish between the genuine product and the product being passed off as genuine one\n
\n In <i>Seven Up Bottling Company Ltd v. Bubble Up International Ltd (1971) 1 UILR 154,</i> the court upheld the plaintiff‟s objection to the defendant‟s introduction of its product which was a carbonate soft drink similar in outlook to that of the plaintiff.\n
\n <b>Passing off in Relation to Business Name </b>
\n Where there is a similarity between one business name that is in use and another that is about to be formed, such that those doing business with them can easily confuse one for the other, an injunction would lie to restrain the prospective trader from using the name.\n
\n To secure an injunction in passing off in relation to business name, it is neither necessary to prove that deception has taken place, nor that the offender had any intention to deceive. It is enough to prove that the name adopted by the prospective trader is capable of deceiving members of the public into mistaking the business of the competitor for that of the person they originally planned to patronize.\n
\n <b>Trade Mark </b>
\n A trade mark is any visible sign used by the manufacturer of a product to distinguish his product from goods of the same general description by other manufacturer.\n
\n <b>Trade name</b>
\n A trade name is the name or title lawfully adopted and used by a particular organization engaged in commerce. It describes a manufacturer or dealer in terms of business and goodwill.\n
\n <b>Trade Mark Infringement </b>
\n Infringement in relation to trade mark consists of the unauthorised use or colourable imitation of a trade mark on substituted goods of the same class as those for which the trade mark has been appropriated with the result that intending customers would readily confuse one product for the other. An infringement can be committed against goods or trademarks. It was held per Lord Cranworth L.G. in <i>Seixo v. Provenzende (1866) 1 Ch.App 192 at 196</i>, that where a manufacturer has been in the habit of stamping the goods which he has manufactured with a particular brand so that a person purchasing goods of that description know them to be of his manufacturer, no other manufacturer has a right to adopt the same stamp\n
\n <b>Court Jurisdiction in Passing off</b>
\n The right of action in passing off of any registered trade mark is statutory by virtue of section 3 of the Trade Marks Act 1965 and section 7(1) (c) (i) of the Federal High Court Act 1973.\n
\n <i>Section 3 of the Trade Marks Act 1965</i> provides that no person shall be entitled to institute any proceeding to prevent, or to recover damages for the infringement of an unregistered trade mark, but nothing in this Act shall be taken to affect rights of action against any person for passing off goods as the goods of another person or the remedies in respect thereof.\n
\n Consequently, only the Federal high Court can exercise exclusive jurisdiction over cases of infringement of registered trademarks.  Section 7(1) (c) (ii) of the Federal Revenue Court Act 1973 (now Federal High Court Act), provides that the court (i.e. Federal High Court) shall have and exercise jurisdiction in civil causes and matters arising from any enactment relating to copyright, patents, designs, trademarks, and merchandise marks.\n
\n However, where the trade mark allegedly being infringed upon is unregistered, no right of action can lie. Section 3 of the Trade Marks Act provides inter alia that “no person shall be entitled to institute any proceeding to prevent or to recover damages for the infringement of an unregistered trade mark...” However, the plaintiff can sustain an action in common law and such action can only be initiated at the State High Court by virtue of section 272(1) CFRN 1999 as amended which is to the effect that a High Court of a State shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil proceedings in which the existence or extent of a legal right, power, duty, liability, privilege, interest, obligation or claim is in issue. Consequently, the Federal High Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over such action. Where a Federal High Court proceeds to adjudicate over a matter which concerns unregistered trade mark, the trial would be a nullity\n
\n <b>Service Marks </b>
\n Service mark is a mark of identification of a particular trade. It is important to mention that the Trade Marks Act does not provide for service marks. Consequently, it is not registrable under the statute, and no liability is attracted on infringement of service mark.\n
        \n <b>Who can sue and be sued?</b>
\n An action cannot be commenced by, or against a trademark as it is not a juristic person. It is the proprietor of a trademark (i.e., the person to whom a trademark has been appropriated or assigned) that can sue and be sued.\n
\n <b>Reliefs </b>
\n A successful proof of a case in passing off entitles a plaintiff to two major reliefs, namely:
\n 1. An injunction to restrain the defendant from further acts that are detrimental to plaintiff‟s goodwill and business prospects. An injunction may be interlocutory or perpetual.\n
\n2.  A pecuniary damages for the loss already suffered by the plaintiff. In <i>Madam Ogunlende v. S.A. Babayemi</i>  – the defendant who broke away from the plaintiff business under the name Mercury Builders then operated his own under the name “Mercury Builders Nigeria Ltd”. The plaintiff action for an injunction and damages succeeded.\n
\n <b>Deceit or Fraud</b>
\n This is another form of economic tort. It is another way by which economic tort can be committed. The tort of deceit arises when a person falsely or fraudulently makes a false statement with the intent that it shall be acted upon by the person to whom the representation is made.\n
\n The essential elements of the tort of deceit were summarised by Lord Maugham in the case of <i>Bradford Building Society v. Borders (1941) 2 ALL E.R. 205 at 211</i> as follows:
\n 1. There must be a representation of fact\n
\n 2. The representation must be made falsely\n
\n 3. The plaintiff must have acted on the false statement\n
\n 4. The plaintiff must have suffered damage by so doing\n
\n 5. The representation must have been made wilfully with the knowledge that it is false or without any genuine belief that it is true.\n
\n <b>Injurious Falsehood</b>
\n Injurious falsehood as a form of economic tort refers to false statement made maliciously about a person, his property or goods, with the result that he suffers damage and financial loss to his business, mainly in the form of decline in patronage and clientele. The tort of injurious falsehood may be committed in the form of:\n
\n 1. Slander of title\n
\n 2. Slander of goods\n
\n 3. False statements which damage plaintiff‟s trade or business, and\n
\n4. Passing off

    <string name="fatal">Fatal Accidents</string>
    <string name="fatal1"><b>Introduction</b>
\n The common law maxim “actio personalis moritur cum persona” which simply translates to “a personal action dies with the person” prescribes the termination of most civil actions on the death of the plaintiff. However, it was soon discovered that this principle worked against the interest of beneficiaries of estate of such deceased one whose interests deserve some protection even at death. There was therefore the need to avoid a generalisation of this principle\n
\n <b>Personal Actions </b>
\n Personal actions refer to those actions which do not survive the plaintiff at death. Examples of these actions include defamation, damages for adultery, seduction, inducing one‟s spouse to live apart from the other. In <i>Mbadinuju v. Ezuka [1994] 8 NWLR (Pt. 364) 535</i>, the Supreme Court clearly identified the types of actions which stand extinguished at the death of the litigant to include the following:
\n 1. Defamation\n
 \n 2. Damages for adultery,\n
 \n 3. Seduction,\n
\n 4. Inducing one‟s spouse to live apart from the other\n
\n <b>Non-personal Actions </b>
\n Non-personal actions are those actions which do not terminate at the death of the plaintiff. Examples of these actions include nuisance, and trespass to land. However, by statutory provisions, some actions or causes are specially set out and elevated to the status of those surviving the plaintiff\n
\n In <i>Adebisi v. Saska [1995] 8 NWLR (Pt. 414) 475</i>, it was held that a chieftaincy case survives (by way of substitution) the death of a litigant under the relevant provisions of the Administration of Estates Laws of Ogun State\n
\n Under the Fatal Accidents Act of 1961, a cause of action can arise from the incidence of death. It confers a right of action on the beneficiaries of a deceased person.\n
\n <b>Definition of an Accident </b>
\n An accident is an unintended and unexpected occurrence which produces hurt or loss. A fatal accident is an accident which results in death.\n
\n <b>The Law on Fatal Accident in Nigeria </b>
\n The extant law on fatal accidents in Nigeria is the Fatal Accidents Act of 1961 which has been codified into Fatal Accidents Laws in some States of the Federation. The Act was enacted to provide compensation to families of victims killed in accidents. The Act which comprises of nine sections\n
\n Scope of the Act\n
\n The Fatal Accidents Act of 1961 applies not only to cases of fatal motor accident, but to all types of fatal accidents. In <i>Nzekwe v. NNPC [1990] 5 NWLR (Pt. 153) 691</i>, the defendant was held liable in damages under the Act for the fire incident which resulted from the use of adulterated kerosene by the deceased (plaintiff‟s wife). expressly states the categories of persons who can maintain an action under the Act to include members of the immediate family of the deceased.\n
\nWho can Sue? Under common law, executors or administrators or personal representatives could not sue or be sued for any tort committed against or by the deceased in his lifetime\n
\nOne of the objectives of the Fatal Accidents Law is the abolition of the rule that prevents the prosecution of claim in tort for personal injury, where the person who would otherwise be plaintiff or defendant in an action has died. See<i> ITT (Nig) Ltd v. Okpon [1989] 2 NWLR (Pt. 103) 337.</i>\n
\n <b>Requirement for a successful claim </b>
\n The Act makes it mandatory for the plaintiff to give full particulars of the deceased persons. The plaintiff is also required to give full particulars of the nature of the claim for damages. A defendant can pay the compensation meant for the plaintiff into court, and the court has power to share or apportion the compensation among the beneficiaries as it deems fit\n
\n <b>Jurisdiction of Courts </b>
\n The law is to the effect that a plaintiff can only sue in the court which has jurisdiction over the place or scene where the accident occur which resulted in the deceased‟s death. For example, if an accident occurs in Okada in Ovia North East, Benin City, Edo State, the appropriate court to initiate an action is the court a court within Edo State even though the deceased is from Jos and the owner of the vehicle from Jos also.\n
\n<b> Time Limit/Statute Barred</b>
\n Under the Fatal Accidents Act of 1961, any member of the deceased immediate family who is desirous of instituting an action is required to do so within a period of three years from the date of the deceased person‟s death.\n
\n <b>Assessment of Damages under the Act</b>
\n The Fatal Accidents Act, 1961 does not specify how damages are to be assessed in cases brought under the Act. However, the Act requires a person making a claim thereunder to state full particulars of the persons for whom and on whose behalf the action is brought, and of the nature of the claim for damages.\n
\n Funeral Expenses\n
\n A claimant for damages can under the Fatal Accidents Law claim funeral damages.\n
\n <b>Calculation of the Deceased’s Income </b>
\n It is a requirement of the law that before an award is made in fatal accident cases, the income of the deceased must be ascertained. The source of income and the exact amount must be proved in evidence, for such could form the basis of earnings. After such ascertainment, the portion of the earning not used for the support of his dependant will be deducted from the total annual earnings. What is left is regarded as the annual dependency  due to the dependant.\n
\n In an action for damages under the Fatal Accidents Law, the court must make a finding as to the earnings of the deceased before proceeding to determine the annual dependency of the deceased. <i>Omole &amp; Sons Ltd v. Adeyemo [1994] 4 NWLR (Pt. 336) 48</i>\n
\n <b>Damages of Loss of Pecuniary Benefits in Cases involving Children </b>
\n Even though courts have been consistent in the parameters used for the calculation of deceased‟s income and the assessment of damages in torts causing death, the courts however take a different view in respect of benefits payable for the death of children.\n
\n However, a court would award damages where the bereaved parent can prove that the pecuniary value of the child exceed the cost of her maintenance and education. <i>Wolfe v. Great Northern Railway Co. (1890) 26 L.R. Ex. 548</i>\n
\n <b>Joinder of Insurance Companies</b>
\n In an action for damages in motor accident cases, it is not necessary to join the insurance company as a party to the proceedings before the insurance can become liable to indemnify the defendant. All that is necessary is to give the insurance company due notice of the proceedings as required in their insurance policy. The reason behind this rule is that the insurance company was neither the driver nor the owner of the vehicle which caused the accident, and the contract of insurance or indemnity does not exist between the insurance company and the plaintiff, by virtue of the doctrine of privity of contract.\n
\n <b>Defences </b>
\n1. Contributory negligence: a defendant who is sued under this Act is entitled to plead the defence of contributory negligence on the part of the deceased person and where defence is successfully pleaded, it would reduce the damages recoverable by the immediate family of the deceased.\n
</string>
    <string name="defi">Defamation</string>
    <string name="def">The term defamation has been defined by a plethora of legal authorities. The Black‟s Law Dictionary, 10th Edition defines defamation as “Malicious or groundless harm to the reputation or good name of another by the making of a false statement to a third party.\n
\n A standard definition is adopted by Winfield and Jolowicz on Law of Tort 18th Edition. According to these learned authors “Defamation is the publication of a statement which reflects on a person‟s reputation and tends to lower him in the estimation of right thinking members of the society generally, or which tends to make them shun or avoid that person”\n
\n From the above definitions, it is clear that defamation is any statement, however made (public or private), which is adversely reflective on the name or reputation of another is capable of being defamatory and upon which an action can be maintained\n
\n<b> Types of Defamation</b>
\n There are two types of defamation, these are; libel and slander. The distinction between these two torts is that while libel is a defamatory statement made in visible permanent form such as written or printed statement, Slander on the other hand is a statement made in a transitory form and not in a permanent form, most often through the medium of spoken words or gesture.\n
\n <b>Libel</b>
\n As stated earlier, libel is a defamatory statement made in visible permanent form such as written or printed statement, e.g. books, newspapers, notes, circular, painting, photograph, films, letters and memoranda. Presently, the general view is that the test of libel is whether the publication is in a permanent form. Therefore libel is defamation in a permanent form, the most common being written or printed words contained in, for example, newspaper, a book, a letter, a writing, printed materials etc\n
\n <b>Slander</b>
\n On the other hand, slander is defamation in a transient form, most often through the medium of spoken words or gestures. It follows that defamation in the sign language of the deaf and dumb, and mimicking and gesticulation generally would be slander. See <i>Cook v. Cox (1814) 3 M. &amp; S 110</i>. It has been opined in some quarters that libel is addressed to the eye, whilst slander is addressed to the ear. On this footing, it is a matter of serious doubt whether defamatory statements contained in gramophone records, tape recording are libel or slander as they are in permanent form, though addressed to the ear.\n
\n <b>Importance of the Distinction between Libel and Slander </b>
\n Although libel and Slander were separate torts, they are now treated as two aspects of the single tort of defamation and are generally governed by the same principle. For the purpose of emphasis, while libel is actionable per se that is, without the need to prove special (i.e. actual damage), slander is not actionable per se except in certain cases.\n
\n <b>LIBEL ACTIONABLE PER SE</b>
 \n There is no doubt that libel is an aspect of the tort of defamation that is actionable without proof of damages. This means that whenever a claimant proves that libel has been published, the law will presume that injury has been caused to the plaintiff"s reputation and will accordingly, award him damages by way of compensation. This principle of law was encapsulated in <i>Cross River State Newspaper Corp v. J.L. Oni and 6 others (1995) 1 NWLR (Pt. 371) 270-497, G – A</i>. where the court held as follows: Once the plaintiff in a libel case proves that a libel has been published of him without legal justification, his cause of action is complete. Damage is presumed and he need not prove that he has suffered any actual damage or injury to his reputation. See also the case of <i>Nthenda v. Alade (1974) 4 E.C.S.L.R. 470</i>\n
\n Exceptional cases in which slander is actionable per se\n
\n 1. Imputation of a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment: in instances where the defendant alleges that the plaintiff has committed a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment it is slander actionable without proof of special damage. See <i>Okolo v Midwest Newspaper Corp. (1977) 1 SC 33</i>\n
\n 2. Imputation of Certain Diseases: an imputation of a contagious or infections disease is likely to prevent people from associating with the claimant, and is therefore, actionable per se. Some legal scholars like Salmond on Torts; Winfield and Jolwicz hold the view that contagious venereal diseases are included within this exception, and some would also include leprosy, plague or any contagious skin disease caused by personal uncleanliness. There appears to be no modern Nigeria or English case in which this exception has been considered.\n
        \n 3. Imputation of Adultery: at common law, an imputation of unchastity to either sex required special damage, but the Slander of Women Act 1891 made it actionable per se to impute unchastity or adultery concerning any woman or girl. In <i>Kerr v. Kennedy (1942) 1 K.B. 409</i>, where unchastity was been held to include lesbianism\n
\n 4. Imputation of Incompetence: it is actionable per se to impute to any person unfitness, dishonesty or incompetence in any office, profession, calling trade or business carried out by him at the time when the slander was published. Examples of such statements are that a surgeon is incompetent, that a banker is fraudulent; that can engineer has no technique; that a lawyer knows no law; that a trader is insolvent, etc.\n
\n <b>Vulgar Abuse</b>
\n Generally, words spoken as mere vulgar abuse or insult are not actionable in defamation. See <i>Ekong v. Otop (2014) 11 NWLR 549</i>. Put differently, words uttered by a defendant in the heat of passion or quarrel, may not constitute defamation. However, this is “largely dependent on the circumstances surrounding the use of such words". <i>Bakare v Ishola (1959) W.N.L.R. 106</i>\n
\n <b>INGREDIENTS OF DEFAMATION </b>
\n Whether the case is one of libel or slander, the following elements must be proved by the claimant:
\n 1. The statement must be defamatory;\n
\n 2. The Words or statement must refer to the plaintiff\n
 \n 3. The statement must be published; that is, communicated to at least one person other than the plaintiff. See <i>Aromolaran v. Agoro (2014) 18 NWLR (Pt. 1438) 153</i>.\n
 \n The statement must be defamatory.\n
\n A plaintiff, who desires to succeed in an action for defamation must prove that the words are defamatory. The logical question that follows from this standpoint is: how do you determine or ascertain whether the words are defamatory? Naturally, the onerous bulk task rests on shoulders of that judge who should construe the words according to the natural and ordinary meaning which would be given them by reasonable persons of ordinary intelligence who are unusually suspicious.\n
\n<b>The Innuendos </b>
\n The word innuendo is derived from the Latin root word \'innuere\' which means “to hint”. Innuendo is the use of words which are not defamatory in themselves, but are defamatory because of a special or secondary meaning, surrounding facts or circumstances which are known to those to whom it is published.\n
\n <b>Types of Innuendo </b>
\n The authors of Kodilinye and Aluko classify innuendo as either\n
\n 1. True or legal innuendo, and\n
\n 2. False or popular innuendo\n
\n <b>True or Legal Innuendo </b>
\n Under this type of innuendo, the plaintiff contends that although the words used are not defamatory on their face, but they do convey a defamatory meaning to persons to whom they are published because of certain special facts or circumstance not set out in the words themselves, but known to those persons.\n
\n <b>False or Popular Innuendo</b>
\n This is a statement which is defamatory not because of any extraneous facts or circumstances known to the people to whom it is published, but because of the defamatory inference, meaning, or conclusion which reasonable people will draw from the words that have been used. Here, the plaintiff contends that the words are defamatory, not because of any special extrinsic facts or circumstance known to those to whom the word were published, but because of some defamatory inference which reasonable persons generally would draw from the words themselves. A false innuendo goes beyond the literal meaning of words, but is inherent in them\n
\n <b>Words must refer to the plaintiff</b>
\n Another requirement that must be met in an action for defamation is that the words complained of must refer to the plaintiff. In other words, he must prove that he is the person defamed. This requirement is often not a problem if the claimant is mentioned by name.\n
\n <b>GROUP DEFAMATION </b>
\n If the statement in question relates to a group of individuals, it will be difficult for the claimant to establish that the words refer to him or her directly. However, if the group in question has legal identity, for example is a company, it can sue for loss of the group‟s reputation. Generally, no action for group defamation will stand unless:\n
 \n 1. The class is so small that the claimant can establish that the statement must apply to every member of the class, or\n
\n 2. The claimant can show that the statement refers to him or her directly\n
\n <b>Statement must be published </b>
\n The plaintiff must prove that the defamatory statement was published or communicated by the defendant to a third party. In Nigeria, the court per Ogunbiyi, J.C.A in <i>Vanguard Media Ltd v. Olafisoye (2011)14 NWLR (Pt. 1267) 207 at 234</i>, in quoting with approval, the dictum of <i>Aderemi JCA in Bashorun v. Ogunlewe [2000] N.W.L.R. (Pt. 646) 121 at 231 – 232,</i> Para H-A defined publication as follows: “Publication of a defamatory statement is an essential element of the cause of action in libel cases ….. And publication is the act of making the defamatory statement known to any person or persons other than the plaintiff himself. Of course publication must be proved by credible evidence.\n
\n Generally, special rules apply to communication or publication between husband and wife. A publication of a defamatory matter by a husband to his wife or vice versa is not publication as husband and wife are treated as one person. This was the decision of the court in <i>Wenhak v. Morgan (1888) 20 QBD 635.</i>\n
\n <b>Who can sue? </b>
\n 1. Any living human being\n
\n 2. Companies\n
 \n <b>Companies</b>
\n Although a company is not a real person and thus lacks personal feeling, yet it does have business reputation to protect since the law of defamation is concerned with reputation and not personal feelings. On this premise therefore, a company can sue for defamation. In <i>South Hetton Coal Co. v. North – Eastern News Association Ltd. (1894) QB 133</i>, the Court of Appeal held that the company was entitled to sue a newspaper which had alleged that properties in which the company housed its employees were unhygienic. A libel calculated to injure the company trading reputation was held to be actionable\n
\n On the other hand, where the statement does not reflect on the trading or business of a corporation or company, no action or defamation will lie. See <i>Edem v. Orpheo;</i>\n
\n A company cannot sue for libel unless it is defamed in the way of its business. A company can only sued for loss of profit, shortfall in turnover, anticipatory loss or goodwill but not for natural grief and distress and definitely not for social disadvantage.\n
\n <b>Who Cannot Sue? </b>
\n 1. Governmental bodies\n
\n 2. Political parties\n
\n <b>Governmental Bodies</b>
\n The House of Lords in <i>Derbyshire C.C. v. Times Newspapers Ltd (1993) A C 534</i>, held that institutions of government could not sue for defamation.\n
\n This decision is therefore significant in recognizing that it is in the public interest that individuals are free to question the government. It would be contrary to the democratic process and freedom of expression for government to have a right to sue in defamation and would place an undesirable restraint on freedom of speech. See <i>A.G. v. Guardian (1988) 2 WLR 805.</i>\n
\n <b>Political Parties</b>\n
 \n In <i>Goldsmith v. Bhoyrul (1998) QB 770</i>, the court held that a claim for defamation by the Referendum Party cannot be sustained. In <i>New York Imo v. Sullivan (1964) 376 U.S 254</i>, the Supreme Court held that in the light of the protection of freedom of speech in the first Amendment, public figures may only sue if they can present clear and convincing evidence of actual malice by the publisher\n
\n Other persons that cannot sue include dead persons - <i>Awoniyi v. Regt. Business (1990) NWLR (Pt 154)</i>; and Secret Societies.\n
\n <b>Damages</b>
 \n An aggrieved claimant who sues a defendant for defamation does so because he desires to claim damages for the injury to his reputation. But what are the factors to be considered by the court in assessing damages? In <i>Mirchandani v. Pinheiro (2001) 3 NWLR (Pt.701) 557</i>, the court highlighted six factors to be considered in assessing damages viz:
\n (a) The actual pecuniary loss;\n
\n (b) The anticipated pecuniary loss;\n
\n (c) The social disadvantage which results;\n
\n (d) The natural injury to the plaintiff feelings;\n
 \n (e) The social standing of the plaintiff and\n
\n (f) The rate of inflation which has adversely affected the value of the national currency\n
\n <b>Defences to Defamation</b>
\n There are four major defences available to a defendant which he can rely upon in actions for defamation. These include:
 \n1. Justification (Truth)\n
\n2. Fair Comment\n
 \n3. Qualified Privilege\n
\n4. Absolute Privilege\n
\n5. Res Judicata\n
 \n <b>Justification (Truth)</b>
\n As earlier noted, the law of defamation seeks to protect a person‟s reputation. It therefore follows that a person who lacks reputation cannot sue for defamation. In other words, it is a defence to an action for defamation that the words complained of were true in substance. See <i>ASUU v. Ogusanwo (2014) 17 NWLR (Pt.1437) 495.</i>\n
\n <b>Fair Comment</b>
 \n Doubtless, it is a defence to an action for defamation that the statement is a fair comment on a matter of public interest. Fair comment is an impartial observation, opinion or criticism on a matter of public interest, currency, or discourse, it is a dispassionate expression of opinion on fact correctly stated. Therefore, it is a defence to an action for libel or slander that the statement complained of was fair comment on a matter of public interest.\n
 \n For a defence of fair comment to succeed in an action of defamation, a defendant is obliged to prove the following ingredients:\n
 \n 1. The facts on which he based his comment must be true and existing;\n
 \n 2. The matter was one of public interest and;\n
\n 3. The comment was a fair inference from the facts.\n
\n <b>Qualified Privilege </b>
\n A qualified privileged statement is one which enjoys the privilege of protection when made without malice and with honest belief in its truth. <i>African Newspaper (Nig) Plc v. Lt. General Jeremiah Oseni (2015) 3 NWLR (Pt.s 1447) 464</i>\n
\n <b>Absolute Privilege</b>
 \n A defendant would be availed of the defence of absolute privilege in the following circumstance such as proceeding in the legislature or in a court of law, where public policy demands that persons should be able to speak or write with absolute freedom, without fear of liability for defamation. Absolute privilege covers the following:\n
\n 1. Statement made in the course of and with reference to judicial proceedings by any judge, jurymen, advocate, party or witness. This privilege extends to defamatory statement contained in trial and pre-trial documents,<i>Adene v. Oyeyemi (1969) 7 NNLR 37</i>\n
\n 2. Statements made in proceeding of the legislature. This is properly regarded as a matter of immunity from legal action rather than a defence\n
\n 3. Communications made by one officer of state to another in the course of his official duty. The leading case here is <i>Chatterton v. Secretary of State for India (1895) 2 QB 189</i>,; where it was held that a letter from the United Kingdom Secretary of State for India to his Parliamentary Under-Secretary, which provided material for the answer to a question raised in Parliament, was absolutely privileged. This privilege certainly includes communication between high ranking officers of state such as Ministers or Ambassadors and High Commissioners.\n
\n <b>Res Judicata </b>
\nThis is stopping of the plaintiff from filing a fresh suit, because one has earlier been filed by him or his privies, and has been contested and won or lost. This principle of law which bars a fresh action or re-litigation of a matter all over is based on the principle of law that there has to be an end to litigation, so that injury can heal, and the parties may renew their friendly relationship where possible\n

    <string name="intdef">Internet Defamation</string>
    <string name="intdef1">Defamation is the publication of a statement which reflects on a person‟s reputation and tends to lower him in the estimation of right thinking members of the society generally, or which tends to make them shun or avoid that person. It is any expression or publication that damages the reputation of another person for which he can seek redress by suing for damages or demanding that a public apology be tendered in a widely read newspaper.\n
\n Internet defamation is the use of social media tools including networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Webcast, Google Plus, Blogs, YouTube, etc. to damage a person or corporate body.\n
\n For the tort of defamation to be said to have been committed, four elements must be present. One of such element is that the statement must be defamatory. A plaintiff, who desires to succeed in an action for defamation must prove that the words are defamatory. In <b>Ekong v. Otop (2014) 11 NWLR 549 at 568</b>, Okoro JSC held that in deciding whether a word is capable of defamatory meaning, the court would reject that meaning which can only emerge as a product of some strained or forced or utterly unreasonable interpretation.\n
\n Another requirement (element) that must be met in an action for defamation is that the words complained of must refer to the plaintiff. In other words, he must prove that he is the person defamed.\n
\n Another element which must be present before the tort of defamation can be said to have occurred is that the statement must be published. The plaintiff must prove that the defamatory statement was published or communicated by the defendant to a third party\n
\n The complex nature of internet defamation raises some salient legal issues that cast doubt as to whether liability under internet defamation would be equivalent to liability under the traditional defamation. Part of the hurdles which a claimant may be confronted with under internet defamation is that while it is an elementary position of the law on defamation that where a libellous publication is published in a newspaper or book, everyone involved in its publication or in procuring its publication is prima facie liable, the same principle may not be applicable to internet publication where internet Service Providers have little control over the volume of defamatory statements published. Other challenges associated with internet defamation include jurisdiction where the matter would be tried, identity of the internet publisher among other issues. Therefore, there is a pressing need for legislative intervention to cater for these hurdles\n
\n With the advent of modern communication facilities like the internet, the distinction between libel and slander now seems obsolete. On the basis of the above, it becomes probing to ask whether internet defamation, by its peculiar nature is libel or slander. In the first place, it may be argued that internet libel is ephemeral in the sense that defamation statements published online can easily be deleted within a twinkle of an eye even after millions of persons may have had access to the statement.\n
\n <b>Challenges of Internet Defamation</b>
\n 1. Jurisdiction/Governing Law: the issue of jurisdiction is a very serious matter in judicial proceedings. Where for instance an alleged defamatory material is published on the internet about a person based in Nigeria and it is read by someone based in say, America, would the Nigerian courts have competence to adjudicate upon the defamatory matter? Would a Nigerian who alleges that he has been defamed have to go to America to sue? Definitely, this is going to be difficult. Again, what law should be applicable?\n
\n 2. Identity of the party responsible for the defamatory statement: another hurdle which a claimant may like face in the course of seeking a redress in the tort of internet defamation is the task of identifying the party responsible for making the defamatory statement. Put differently, how can one identify whose fingers were on the keyboard at the particular time when the defamatory statement was sent. Where a person creates fake identity, it becomes difficult to identify the person. Even where the person used his real identity, the issue of hacking another person‟s account further compounds this problem\n
\n 3. Liability in internet defamation: yet another hurdle which a claimant may face in an action for internet defamation is the issue of liability. Would the Internet Service Provider be vicariously held liable for the defamatory statement posted by a person using his site? Considering the volume and speed with which information is passed to the internet, it is almost impracticable for the Internet Service Provider to sensor the information with a view to blocking the ones that are defamatory

    <string name="mal">Malicious Prosecution</string>
    <string name="mal1"><b>Introduction</b>
\n Malicious Prosecution is an interesting area of the law of torts which seeks to protect citizens from being unduly harassed by concocted criminal cases. However, in defending the rights of persons in this regard, the courts are often very cautious so as not to discourage patriotic citizens who assist law-enforcement agents in bringing criminals to justice. This public policy requirement of ensuring that persons are not discouraged from initiating genuine prosecution suggests that the availability of the tort of malicious prosecution is subject to a number of restrictive conditions. A plaintiff who alleges that the tort of malicious prosecution has been committed against him is obliged to prove all the essential ingredients.\n
\n <b>What is Malicious Prosecution?</b>
\n The tort of malicious prosecution arises where the defendant maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause takes steps to commence criminal prosecution against the plaintiff which ends in his (plaintiff‟s) favour and results in damage to his reputation, person or property.\n
\n <b>Essentials of Malicious Prosecution </b>
\n In order to succeed in an action for Malicious Prosecution, the plaintiff must prove the following:
\n 1. That the defendant instituted a prosecution against him;\n
\n 2. That the prosecution ended in the plaintiff‟s favour;\n
\n 3. That the defendant had no reasonable and probable cause for prosecution;\n
\n 4. That the defendant acted with malice.\n
\n 5. That the plaintiff suffered damages to his person, reputation and property\n
\n <b>Institution of Prosecution </b>
\n It is apt to observe that to be liable under this head, there must have been a prosecution. In the words of the Court in <i>Musa v Yusuf [2006] 6 NWLR (Pt. 777) 454 at 468</i>, „to prosecute means to set in motion the law, whereby an appeal is made to some person with judicial authority with regard to the matter in question‟. In other words, the defendant must be shown to have initiated the proceedings which were taken against the plaintiff.\n
\n Kodilinye and Aluko dwelt extensively on the principles established by authorities as to what constitutes “Setting the law in motion”. These principles shall be discussed as follows.\n
\n a. In ascertaining what constitutes setting the law in motion, the defendant would be liable if he takes a step such as laying information before a Magistrate on the basis of which the magistrate then issued a summons against the plaintiff. Therefore, it is not necessary that the defendant should have actually conducted the prosecution. <i>Inneh v Aruegbon (1952) 14 W.A.C.A. 73,</i>\n
\n b. In instances where the prosecution has not commenced, the defendant may still be liable for Malicious Prosecution especially if the proceedings were conducted in such a manner as to injure the reputation of the plaintiff. <i>Mohammed Amin v Bannerjee (1947) A.C. 322</i>\n
\n c. To be liable for Malicious Prosecution, a person must be actively instrumental in setting the law in motion. Merely giving information to the Police is not enough. In effect, where the defendant merely informs the police of a certain facts which incriminate the plaintiff, and the police as a result decide to prosecute, the defendant will not be regarded as having instituted the proceedings since the decision to prosecute is not his and the stone set rolling by the defendant is a stone of suspicion only. However, it was established in the leading case of <i>Tewari v. Singh (1908) 24 T.L.R. 884</i>, that if the defendant knowingly makes a false accusation to the police or a judicial officer, with the result that an innocent man is sent for trial, he will be liable as prosecutor, even though the prosecution was not technically conducted by him\n
\n <b>Termination of Prosecution in Plaintiff’s Favour</b>
 \n Another ingredient that must be established in an action for Malicious Prosecution is that the criminal proceeding ended in favour of the plaintiff. This means that a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence cannot sue for malicious prosecution, even though he can prove that he was really innocent and that the charge was malicious and unfounded. If a person were allowed to sue for malicious prosecution after the criminal trial had ended adversely to him, it would amount to re-opening of the issue of his guilt and this would amount to challenging the propriety of the conviction. Indeed, the court will not reopen a criminal case where a person attempts to challenge his conviction through an action in malicious prosecution. A person who is dissatisfied with the outcome of a criminal proceeding has a right to appeal.\n
\n Termination of prosecution in plaintiff‟s favour can be discussed under the following principles:\n
\n a. Entering of a nolle prosequi: the term nolle prosequi is a Latin word used in reference to a formal entry upon the record made by a prosecutor in a criminal action in which the individual declares that he or she wishes to discontinue the action as to certain issues altogether. The statement which means “we shall no longer prosecute” is an admission that the charges cannot be proved, that evidence has demonstrated either innocence or fatal flaw in the prosecutions claim, or the Prosecution has become conversed that the accused is innocent.\n
\n b. No case submission: the process of a criminal trial gives opportunity to an accused person to make a no case submission after the prosecution closes its case. It is one of the options opened to an accused person at the closure of the prosecution‟s case. It should be noted that when a submission of no prima facie case is made on behalf of an accused person the Court is not thereby called upon to at that stage to express any opinion on the evidence before it. The court is called upon at that stage to observe and rule accordingly that there is before the Court, no legally admissible evidence linking the accused person with the commission of the offence with which he was charged\n
\n c. Discharge on Technical grounds and conditional discharge: Can the discharge of an accused on technical ground or a conditional discharge be said to have effectively terminated a criminal action under the tort of malicious prosecution? The answer to this question may be answered in the negative\n
\n Absence of Reasonable and Probable Cause\n
\n This third requirement is perhaps the hardest to satisfy. In the first place, it involves proof of a negative by the plaintiff, which is an onerous task. Scholars have observed that the requirement of proving a negative is a very difficult condition to satisfy unless the plaintiff has hard evidence to show that the prosecuting officers lacked an honest belief in the charges which were being brought. The task therefore falls on the judge to determine whether there was a lack of reasonable and probable cause.\n
\n <b>The Defendant Acted With Malice</b>\n
\n Generally speaking, malice means the intent, without justification or excuse to commit a wrongful act. According to the Black‟s Law Dictionary, Malice means in law, a wrongful intention.\n
\n It is worthy of note that under this head, the plaintiff is required to prove a negative being either immediate or ulterior, the ulterior intent being commonly distinguished as the motive. The term „malice‟ is applied in law to both these forms of intents and the result is somewhat ambiguous. An act is said to be done maliciously if it is either done intentionally with wrongful motive.\n
\n The plaintiff suffered damages to his person, reputation or property This is yet another essential which a plaintiff is required to prove in order to succeed in an action for malicious prosecution. Generally, the essence of the tort of malicious prosecution is to assuage the feelings of a plaintiff who had been subjected to an unwarranted criminal trial. To achieve this end, the plaintiff must show that injury has been done to his fame, his person or property. By necessary implication, the plaintiff must show that the charge brought against him was defamatory. See <i>Wiffen v Bailey (1915) K.B. 600.</i>\n
\n In <i>Rayson v South London Tramways C. (1893) 2 QB 304</i>, damage to fame was established where the plaintiff was wrongfully accused of having travelled on a bus without paying the fare, since the accusation implied that he was a dishonest person and a cheat.\n

    <string name="anilia">Liability for Animals</string>
    <string name="anilia1">Generally, the position of the law is that a person who owns or keeps animals is duty bound to take care of them so that they do not harm or cause nuisance or injury to another person. Therefore, the law holds the owner strictly liable for injuries caused by their animals. Liability for animals under the Law of Tort is classified into two;
\n 1. Scienter Action (liability for dangerous animals)\n
\n 2. Cattle Trespass.\n
\n <b>SCIENTER ACTION (LIABILITY FOR WILD ANIMALS) </b>
\n This deals with liability for animals that are dangerous. Strict liability is imposed upon a person who keeps a dangerous animal which causes damage to another person. This assertion was affirmed in <i>May v Burdett (1846) 115 ER. 1213</i> when Denman C.J. stated the law thus: “A person keeping a mischievous animal with knowledge of its propensities to attack humans is bound to keep it secure at his peril\n
\n Under scienter action, dangerous animals are classified into two categories, viz:
 \n 1. Animal ferae naturae and\n
\n 2. Animal mansuetae naturae\n
\n <b>Animal Ferae Naturae</b>
 \n These are animals which by their nature are presumed to be wild and dangerous, and the keeper of such an animal is liable for any arm it may cause without proof that the particular animal was savaged.\n
\n Thus, in <i>Behrens v Bertram Mills Circus (1957) 2 Q.B. 1</i>, the owner of the tame elephant in circus was held liable for the acts of the elephant in attacking the plaintiff. The fact that the elephant had never attacked anyone in the past was of no relevant.\n
\n <b>Animals Mansuete Naturae </b>
\n These are animals belonging to specie which is naturally harmless, though individuals may harbour a vicious disposition. This is so because they occasionally attack persons and cause harm. Examples are cows, horses, goats, camels, cats and dogs.\n
\n It worthy to note that the knowledge of the defendant would also be held to exist if the knowledge of the vicious propensity was acquired by the person to whom the defendant had delegated the custody of the animal. Thus, where the wife or the servant of the defendant had knowledge of the vicious tendency, the plaintiff will succeed in his action. This rule was judicially affirmed in <i>Daryani v Nkoju (1965)2 ALL NLR 53</i>\n
\n <b>Defences to Scienter Action</b>
 \n The common defences to scienter action are;\n
\n 1. Violenti Non Fit Injuria: this defence would apply where the nature of a person‟s work exposes him to the risk of being attacked by animals. In other words, where persons whose livelihood it is to deal with dangerous animals, such as zoo keepers and animal trainers are injured in the course of their work, this defence would avail the owner/employer\n
\n 2. Default of the Plaintiff: this defence would be available to the defendant where at the time the plaintiff was injured by the animal, the latter was trespassing on the defendant‟s land, unless the animal was kept with the deliberate intention of injuring, rather than of merely deterring trespasser. In <i>Sarch v Blackburn (1830) 172 ER 712</i> the court held that a person who trespasses into another man‟s land and is attacked is by the dog cannot succeed in an action against the owner.\n
\n 3. Contributory Negligence: if the plaintiff was entirely responsible for his injury, his action will fail altogether; but if he was merely contributory to the injury through his negligent, his damages will be reduced under the statutory apportionment provisions.\n
\n <b>CATTLE TRESPASS </b>
\n Some legal scholars describe this category of torts as „Livestock Trespass‟ which includes cattle- sheep, pigs, goats, poultry, horses, donkey, asses, camel, mules. These animals are kept for food, wool, skin, for farming or any agricultural activity. This category of animal trespass deals with situations in which the animal in control or possession of the defendant enters into the land of the plaintiff. This may be done intentionally by the defendant or the animal may stray on such land independently.\n
\n <b>Exceptions to Cattle Trespass </b>
\n There would be no liability if the animals lawfully being led on the highway escape from there and stray onto adjacent land. This assertion was judicially affirmed in <i>Tillet v Ward (1882) Q.B.D. 17</i>. This is because the straying of the animals from the highway is considered as a normal hazard associated with leading on the highway. But if the escape is due to the carelessness on the part of the person in control of the cattle on the high way, the latter would be liable in negligence\n
\n <b>Who can Sue?</b>
\n It is imperative to note that it is only a person that has interest in the land trespassed upon that can sue under cattle trespass. Thus, a mere licensee on the land has no right of action.\n
\n <b>Defences </b>
\n The defences to cattle trespass are for the most part, the same as those available under Rylands v Fletcher .They include:\n
\n 1. Default of the plaintiff: that is, where he has failed to maintain an adequate fence when under the duty to do so. See <i>Singleton v Williamson (1891)158 ER 533</i>, where it was held that the defense of the plaintiff‟s default would apply in a situation which the plaintiff neglected to build a fence round his property thus allowing the cattle to stray and cause damage;\n
\n 2. Act of a stranger: e.g. where a third party drives the defendant‟s cattle on the plaintiff‟s land. <i>Smith v Stone (1647) 82 ER 533</i>;\n
 \n 3. Act of God: e.g. where a flash of lightning strikes such terror into the cattle that they stampede onto the plaintiff‟s land.\n
\n <b>LIABILITY FOR ANIMALS IN NIGERIA</b>
\n It is apt to observe that there is a death of authority in this aspect of the law in Nigeria. There are perhaps, some reasons responsible for this. One is tempted to agree with some legal scholars that Nigerians do not have a lot of household pets compared to other jurisdictions. Again, there are few zoos in Nigeria. However, in respect of cattle trespass, the recent incessant clash between farmers and herders has been the subject of debate in many circles. The media has been awash with many reports of persistent conflict between farmers and herders. Research shows that the clash is often triggered by the attempt of herders to graze on farmlands belonging to farmers. This perennial conflict has resulted in the death of many lives, rape by herders, kidnapping, arson and other criminal offences. In the face of this recurrent scourge, it is regrettable to observe that very few judicial decisions exist. It is on record that some states have enacted Anti-grazing Laws to stem the problem. However, unless these laws are tested in courts, this aspect of the law would remain stunted.\n
\n <b>NEGLIGENCE IN LIABILITY FOR ANIMALS</b>
\n There can be liability for negligence regarding animals, if there is no cause of action in animal trespass. In <i>Draper v Hodder</i>, where an infant was attacked by dogs belonging to the defendant, the plaintiff‟s case failed under scienter action because of his failure to prove that the defendant had previous knowledge. The action also failed under the cattle trespass because dogs do not belong to the class of cattle. However, the plaintiff succeeded in bringing an action under negligence. The plaintiff argued that the defendant should have known that dogs were dangerous and should have taken steps to prevent them from doing damage.

    <string name="natcrim">Nature Of Crime</string>
    <string name="natcrim1">It is pretty difficult to give a concise definition of the concept of crime. This is because of the varied nature of criminal law. The word “crime” evolved from the Latin word “Crimen” meaning an accusation. This explains why an offender is usually referred to as an accused person. Crimes are those breaches of the law resulting in special accusatorial procedure controlled by the state, and the offender is liable to sanction over and above compensation and costs.\n
\nIt is therefore not possible to give an all embracing universally acceptable definition of the word crime. This is however not surprising because defining what is law itself has proved to be problematic in the light of the legal thoughts on the matter. It is sometimes argued that crime is a public wrong, whereas private wrongs are addressed by the civil law.\n
\nAccording to Black’s Law Dictionary 9th Edition, “a crime is an act that the law makes punishable; the breach of a legal duty treated as the subject matter of a criminal proceeding.”\n
    \nA guide on the concept of crime has been provided by section 2 of the Criminal Code, Cap C38, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the Criminal Code). The code itself in its several provisions does not use the word “crime,” rather it employs the word “offence.” The word “offence” is synonymous with the word “crime.” Under that section, offence is defined as “an act or omission which renders the person doing the act or making the omission liable to punishment”.\n
\n A crime is an illegal act, omission or event whether or not it is also a tort, breach of contract or breach of trust, the principal consequence of which is that the offender if detected and the police decides to prosecute, is prosecuted by or in the name of the state and if he is found guilty is liable to be punished whether or not he is also ordered to compensate his victim.\n
\n <b>Criminal Law Defined</b>
 \n According to Curzon (1973), criminal law is a branch of public law which deals with the relationship between members of the public and the state. It spells out clearly the trial and punishment of offenders. Sutherland and Cressey (1974) define criminal law as “a list of specific forms of human conduct which has been outlawed by political authority, which applies uniformly to all persons living under the political authority, and which is enforced by punishment administered by the state”\n
\n<b> Characteristics of Crime</b>
\n 1. It must be injurious.\n
 \n 2. The injurious conduct may be the result of an act or omission or indeed both.\n
\n 3. The injurious conduct must be such that has been prohibited or proscribed by the state. That is to say there is no crime except is it proscribed or prohibited by the state.\n
 \n 4. The injurious conduct must be such that attracts penal sanctions which can take the form of a term of imprisonment or a fine or a combination of both\n
\n<b> OBJECTS OF CRIMINAL LAW </b>
\n Generally, the object of the criminal law is punishment of a convicted offender. If punishment is an essential characteristic of a crime what then is the object of punishment? It is not enough that in order to qualify as a crime the injurious conduct or omission must attract sanction\n
\n However, punishment must be designed in such a way as to achieve the following objectives:\n
\n 1. Retribution – fair deserts: this view involves a process of “looking back” at the circumstances of the crime committed, and deciding what punishment the accused deserves for his conduct, having regard to his responsibility for the crime. Punishment in this respect is meant to teach the accused person that crime does not pay. Here, the offender is punished according to his level of involvement in the crime committed. It is like obtaining vengeance against the accused person for the crime he committed against the society.\n
\n 2. Deterrence: the principle of deterrence which is at present probably the most effective principle of punishment takes two forms. Punishment may be imposed in order to discourage the particular accused from offending again, or with the aim of discouraging the general public from doing what the accused did. In this way, knowing how severe the punishment may be, a criminally minded person would rather avoid committing the offence in the light of the consequences that go with it.\n
\n3.  Disablement: punishment may be imposed in order to disable the accused person. This means that the accused person upon the imposition of punishment, e.g. imprisonment, is removed from the society so as to deny them of the opportunity to commit further crime against the society. The greater the danger a criminal poses, the more willing is society that he should be shut off for a considerable time.\n
\n4. . Education: the purpose of punishment may be to educate the people on the evils of committing a particular kind of conduct\n
\n5. Rehabilitation or Reform: sanctions may be imposed on an accused person so as to reform him or rehabilitate him. The purpose of this is to make him useful to himself and the society so that he would voluntarily refrain from committing crime. In order to achieve this, it is common to assign a probation officer to the convict who will monitor or supervise his progress in becoming a responsible member of the society over a period of time.

    <string name="cfscrim">Content, Functions and Scope of Criminal Law</string>
    <string name="cfscrim1"> Criminal law has a variable content. The contents vary from country to country, age to age and from place to place. This is understandable because criminal law is an off-shoot of community ethics and it is also a creation of government policies. Consequently, since what amounts to community ethics in any community will vary from community to community, criminal law is also bound to vary from community to community in its contents. In a similar vein, government policies vary from country to country, even within one country, government policies vary from historical epoch to historical epoch. Hence, the content of criminal law is bound to vary\n
\n The second point to note in the content of criminal law is that criminal law is selective in content, hence, it does not seek to regulate every aspect of human conduct. It only regulates such conducts that are regarded as harmful or injurious to the society which may undermine the very value upon which the society is built.\n
\n Thirdly, criminal law is certain in its content. It is because of the need for certainty that criminal law is largely codified. Further, the need for certainty is the reason why customary criminal law has been abolished by the two principal criminal law legislations, that is the Criminal Code and the Penal Code. Hence the common Latin maxim is nulla poena sine lege meaning no punishment without the law, and it is arising from this Latin maxim that we have <i>section 36(12) of the 1999 Constitution</i> which largely adopts <i>Article 11(2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</i>. Section 36(12) of the CFRN 1999 as amended deals with the need for all criminal offences be in written form and punishment prescribed.\n
\n <b>FUNCTIONS OF CRIMINAL LAW</b>
\nThe following can be identified as the functions of criminal law:\n
\n 1. The preservation of life, safety, privacy and dignity of the human person. The criminal law forbids and prevents conduct that unjustifiably and inexcusably inflicts or threatens substantial harm to individual or public interests.\n
\n 2. The enforcement of morality. The criminal law aimed at preserving public decency. No doubt, some moral wrongs may constitute criminal conducts even though not all moral wrongs are criminal conducts.\n
\n3. The preservation of the dignity and authority of the state. Criminal law spelt out acts that the state considers injurious or harmful and prescribes punishment for engaging in such act. Any act of violation of the state law is usually visited with sanction by the government through its authority as the body with the absolute monopoly of violence.\n
\n 4.The maintenance of public order and tranquillity. Law is a method of social control, a framework specifying the parameters of acceptable behaviour. Any act which has particularly harmful effect on the public is usually subject of punishment by the government.\n
\n 5. The protection of individual liberty. Section 35 of the CFRN 1999 (as amended) guarantees the right to personal liberty of an individual. Offences relating to false imprisonment can be regarded as both tortuous and criminal. Kidnapping a person and keeping him/her without his/her consent is criminal and the criminal law functions to protect individual against such unlawful taking away\n
\n <b>SCOPE OF CRIMINAL LAW </b>
\n Even though the enforcement of morality has been identified as the function of criminal law, it is not always the case. This is because of the contending views on whether law and morality should be kept separate and distinct. While one view is of the opinion that the two should be separate, the other view contends that they do intersect and cannot be completely kept separate.\n
\n Supporters of the former (that is, those who advocate that law and morality should be separate) have argued that morality is an uncertain and vague concept that is incapable of any precise definition, as such, judging law from the standard of morality would mean transporting the vagueness and uncertainty of morality into the legal field. In other words, criminal law should be concerned with the prevention of harm rather than ascribing to itself the task of perfecting human behaviour.\n
\n The opposing view (that is, those who advocate that law and morality should not be kept separate) have argued that law should be a reflection of the moral values of the society and as such the primary purpose of law should be to enforce morality and decency. Further, that crimes are essentially sins or immoral acts. This is still an unending debate and there are some merits in both views.

    <string name="hissou">History and Sources Of Criminal Law</string>
    <string name="hissou1">The term “history of Nigerian criminal law” is concerned with where Nigerian criminal law derives its existence. Criminal law is largely determined by the two criminal law legislations, that is, the Criminal Code and the Penal Code. While the Penal Code operates in the North of Nigeria, the Criminal Code exists in the South of Nigeria. In addition to these two principal legislations, there are several other sources of criminal law. The existence of these two main legislations is rooted in history\n
\nIt is apposite to mention that prior to the arrival of the British or these two legislations, there were two separate systems of criminal law in the Northern Nigeria. These were Islamic criminal law and customary criminal law. While the former (Islamic criminal law) applied exclusively to the followers of the Islamic faith, the latter (customary criminal law) comprised of several and diverse customary criminal rules representing as it were the various tribes or communities in the North.\n
\nIn the Southern part of the country, criminal law was characterised by the existence of various customary rules. It was one of such rules that led to the decision in Aoko v. Fagbemi supra. In 1861 the then King of Lagos signed a treaty with the British which led to the introduction of the English common law of crime in Lagos Colony in 1863, thus, replacing the customary criminal law of Lagos, while the customary criminal law in its varying forms still applied outside Lagos. By 1904 Lord Lugard who became the Governor of Northern Protectorate under British control introduced by proclamation the Queensland Code into Northern Protectorate. The Code was imported from Queensland, Australia. Of course, the introduction of the Queensland Code into the Protectorate also heralded the abolition of the customary Criminal law and Islamic criminal law. In 1914, the Northern Protectorate and the Southern Protectorate with the Colony of Lagos were amalgamated and administered as one country with Lord Lugard as Governor. Consequently, the Queensland Code that was operational in the old Northern Protectorate was extended to the South and this became operational throughout the country in 1916.\n
\nWhile the Queensland Code enjoyed a large measure of success in the South, it created a number of problems in the North. First, adultery and incest which the North found highly objectionable were not codified. Second, the Criminal Procedure Rules that applied under the Queensland rule could not be reconciled with the Islamic way of life of the North. The third problem which confronted the operation of the Code in the North was in the consequence of the defence of provocation. Under the Queensland‟s Code provocation was regarded and recognised as a mitigating defence capable of reducing murder to manslaughter, whereas under the Maliki school/law of Islamic  Jurisprudence which was the main school in Northern Protectorate, the defence was of no consequence (not admitted).\n
\n It could therefore literally be a matter of life and death, according to whether an accused who killed under gross provocation was tried under Maliki law, where the finding would be murder, and the sentence death (if the deceased‟s relative so desire it), or under the Criminal Code where the maximum punishment would be imprisonment for life.\n
\nGenerally speaking therefore, the Queensland Code was largely irreconcilable with the way of life of the Islamic North. In order to reconcile this conflict between the two systems, two steps were taken. Section 4 of the Criminal Code Ordinance of 1904 was amended in 1933. The section laid down the criminal jurisdiction of the court. Hitherto, section 4 of the Criminal Code Ordinance had provided that: “No person shall be liable to be tried or punished in any court in Nigeria „other than a native tribunal‟ for an offence except under the express provisions of the Code or some other Ordinance, or some law, or some Order-In-Council made by his Majesty for Nigeria or under the express provisions of some statute of some Imperial Parliament which is in force in Nigeria or forms part of the law of Nigeria.” In other to delineate the criminal jurisdiction of the court, the expression “other than native tribunal” which appeared in the body of the section was removed/deleted with the intention that punishment only should be affected.\n
\nTerritorial Jurisdiction of the Codes Both Codes have defined territories within which they apply. That means that any person who commits an offence against the criminal or penal law applicable in that territory is liable to be punished by the appropriate court in that territory irrespective of that person‟s nationality or domicile. However, it may be possible that element of an offence occur in the two territories where both Codes  apply. In that situation, it may become difficult to determine which of the two Codes will have territorial jurisdiction over the other. Section 4 of the Penal Code and section 12A of the Criminal Code provide the guide to this question. Both sections provide that in the situation described above, the offender will be liable for trial in the territory where the initial element occurred as if all other subsequent elements had occurred in that territory\n
\n<b>SOURCES OF CRIMINAL LAW IN NIGERIA </b>
\nAs earlier noted, the sources of Nigerian criminal law are basically the Criminal Code applicable in the Southern part of Nigeria and the Penal Code applicable in the Northern part of Nigeria. The third source is made up of other various statutes criminalising specific human activities or omissions. These statutes will include the Economic and Financial Crime Commission Act, the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission Act, Money Laundering Act, Miscellaneous Offences Act, the Custom and Excise Management Act, the National Agency for the Prohibition and Trafficking in Persons and a host of others.\n
\nThese sources are not constant, and they are highly relative in that what may be a crime in one historical epoch may not be at another time in history. For instance, the Foreign Exchange Antisabotage Act which criminalised the possession of foreign exchange while travelling out of the country had ceased to be a crime, provided of course, under the present dispensation it is not in excess of 10,000 dollars or its equivalent. Even where it is excess, all that the law requires is that the amount be declared, and where it is so declared, being in possession of excess of 10,000 dollars will not be a crime

    <string name="genpri">General Principles of Criminal Responsibility</string>
    <string name="genpri1"><b>Elements of an offence</b>
\n In criminal law an offence is constituted by the presence of two elements, that is, the physical element and the mental element. Generally speaking these two elements must be present before it would be said that an offence has been committed.\n
\n The above is only a general rule. By implication, some exceptions do exist where an offence may be committed even though the two elements are either not present or not present contemporarily (i.e. at the same time). Except where this is the case, the physical element and mental element must coexist at one and the same time before an offence is committed.\n
\n <b>How can we identity the physical element of an offence? </b>
\n To answer the above question, reference shall be made to some provisions of the Code to determine what these two elements are. For example, in the definition of offence of stealing under section 383 of the Criminal Code, the physical element would be the taking away of anything capable of being stolen. This is because the section defines stealing as the fraudulent taking away or converting to ones use or to the use of any other person anything capable of being stolen, while the mental element is the state of mind in which that taking away is done, that is, the fraudulent intent to steal that property. So, if the property of another person is taken away without an intention to permanently deprive the owner of it, it is not stealing. What will constitute the actus reus and the mens rea of an offence will vary from offence to offence. In other words, they are not constant.\n
\n Nevertheless, the general rule is that in every offence the actus reus and the mens rea must be present, even though their nature may differ. The general rule of coexistence of the two elements of an offence is expressed in the Latin Maxim “actus non facit reun nisi men sit rea” – which means that “no act is a crime without a guilty mind”\n
\n <b>The Actus Reus</b>
\n The actus reus means the guilty act and it is the outward or external manifestation of the crime. It is the actual act done for the purpose of furthering a guilty intent\n
\n The second point to note is that the actus reus may be constituted by special circumstances or state of affairs\n
\n Finally, when the offence is one of receiving stolen property the state of affairs is that the property in question was stolen. In this case the actus reus will include receipt of a property that is stolen\n
\n <b>Omission</b>
\n The actus reus may also be a mere omission to act. This is so when the law imposes a legal duty on the accused person. The failure to exercise that legal duty would amount omission to act which constitute the actus reus. There are certain carefully defined types of activity where the law imposes duties to do something, and the omission of which constitutes an offence. Section 202 CC provides that it is an offence generally for anyone to omit, without lawful excuse, to perform any duty which he is bound to perform by the provisions of any legislative enactment.\n
\n The duties in this regards are mainly concerned with duties to avoid risk of serious harm to the person where a special relationship exist between the parties. Thus, it is no offence for a man to stand callously by watching another‟s baby drown in a pool of water two feet deep, when it could be the simplest act to save it\n
\n In the final analysis, it would be safe to state that there is no hard and fast rule as to when an omission may constitute the actus reus of a crime and when it does not; one must look at the definition of each particular crime to see whether mere failure to do something constitutes a criminal offence. But where a duty to act is imposed on a person, the breach of which constitutes an offence.\n
\n <b>Mens rea</b>
\n As earlier stated, mens rea means the guilty mind. Most crimes require that the accused person committed the crime in a particular state of mind. That is, that the actus reus was done in a particular state of mind, this state of mind is what is referred to as mens rea. The mens rea of murder is an intention to kill or to cause serious bodily harm, the mens rea of stealing is the fraudulent intent to steal that property as well as to deprive permanently the owner of the property thereof.\n
 \n Implied in the dictum just referred to, is that in some cases the law will dispense with the requirement of mens rea and still criminalise the act whether or not a mental element was present. This as earlier explained are offences of strict liability. The mental element of an offence could take the following (that is, examples of mental elements);\n
\n a. Intention\n
 \n b. Recklessness\n
\n c. Negligence\n
\n d. Knowledge\n
\n e. Rashness\n
\n <b>Intention </b>
\n Intention could mean any of the following; (i) it could mean a desire or will on a part of the accused person to produce a particular result which he was able to produce. (ii) Intention could also mean foresee-ability of a particular result by the accused person of his conduct and the result did in fact happen\n
\n <b>Recklessness</b>
 \n A person may not have intended a particular harm but he may take an unjustifiable risk in causing it, in which case is said to have been reckless. Recklessness is therefore indifference that certain prohibited consequence would arise from one‟s conduct. Recklessness is a convenient term coined to describe those states of mind short of intention, but distinguishable from mere inadvertent negligence because the accused foresaw the consequences of his conduct but risked them. The precise nature of the foresight may vary.\n
\n <b>Negligence</b>
\n Where the accused person fails to perform his duty or fail to avert his mind to the risk of his conduct, even though a man of ordinary reason would have so averted his mind, and if any injury should ensue he would be said to be negligent. In the case of criminal negligence the standard of proof is higher than the tort of negligence. In this case the negligence must be gross or criminal.\n
\n <b>Knowledge</b>
\n This is another form of mens rea or state of mind. It is often required in the definition of specific crime (such as murder) that the accused must have knowledge of certain existing situation before he could be found liable. For instance, on a charge of possessing counterfeit money, the accused must know that he possesses it and that it is counterfeit. Similarly, on a charge of receiving stolen goods, it must be proved that the accused knew that the goods he received were stolen. In the case of <i>R. v. Mba (1937) 3 WACA 190</i>, the court held that there must be proof of knowledge of falsity of the content of a defamatory matter published by the accused person. Note that it is usually difficult to prove guilty knowledge by direct evidence. It has to be inferred from the circumstances of the case which is to be determined by the trial judge.

    <string name="parties">Parties to an Offence</string>
    <string name="parties1">An offence may be planned, hatched and executed by one person against another. It may also involve a member or group of people, or gang undertaking different roles, assume different levels or degrees of involvement and hence merit differential treatment. In criminal law, there are two parties to an offence; these are
\n 1. The principal offender, and\n
\n 2. Accessory after the fact\n
 \n <b>Principal offender</b>
 \n The principal offender is the person who actually commits the offence or causes it to be committed. The relevant provisions can be found in <i>sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Criminal Code and sections 519-521 of the same Criminal Code</i> and apply to all offences (whether contained in the Code or any other enactment) and to all persons.\n
\n Section 7 of the Code creates four categories of persons that may be parties to an offence. These are listed at (a) – (d) of the section. The section provides as follows: “When an offence is committed, each of the following persons is deemed to have taken part in committing the offence and to be guilty of the offence, and may be charged with actually committing it...”\n
\n a. Every person who actually does the act or make the omission which constitutes the offence can be charged for the offence.\n
\n b. Every person who does or omits to do any act for the purpose of enabling or aiding another person to commit the offence can also be charged for the offence as a party.\n
\n c. Every person who aids another person in committing the offence would be charged for it.\n
\n d. Every person who counsels or procures any other person to commit the offence can be charged with it. Under section 7(d) of the Code, there must be some positive act of encouragement given  the accused person to those who committed the unlawful act. The encouragement must go beyond a bare permission or tacit acquiescence.\n
\n On the other hand, the mere presence of a person at the commission of an offence without more is not sufficient to make him a principal offender. Thus in the case of <i>Miller v. The State (2005) 16 WRN 31</i>, the Court of Appeal Lagos Division held that it is unsafe and improper to convict an accused person merely because he was present when an alleged offence or crime was committed without more\n
\n Generally, any person who falls within any of the categories listed in paragraph (a)-(d) of section 7 of the Code is regarded as a principal offender. The consequence of such a classification is that such a person can be charged with a substantive offence. Thus in the case of Agwuna v. A.G. Federation [1995] 5 NWLR (Pt. 396) 418, the court summed up the parties to a crime as follows: participes criminis (parties to a crime) include inter alia any person who actually does the act or make the omission which constitute the offence, persons who aid or abet or assist them in the commission of the offence or who counsels or procures others to commit the offence or knowingly gives succour or encouragement to the commission of the crime or who knowingly facilitate the commission of the crime.\n
\n <b>Common intention (Joint acts) </b>
\n Apart from participes criminis enumerated in section 7 CC above, there are other provisions of the Code also relating to participes criminis. These provisions relate to group offences and are covered by sections 8 and 9 of the Criminal Code.\n
 \n According to <i>section 8 of the Code</i>, “When two or more persons form a common intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose in conjunction with one another, and in the prosecution of such purpose an offence is committed of such a nature that its commission was a probable consequence of the prosecution of such purpose, each of them is deemed to have committed the offence.” Similar provision is contained in <i>section 79 of the Penal Code</i>. That section provides thus: “When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of those persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.”\n
\n It is however important to stress that a crime for which an accused person is charged must be a probable consequence of the execution of a common purpose. Where the offence is not a probable consequence of the execution of a common purpose, the accused person may not be criminally liable.\n
\n The following elements can therefore be extrapolated in section 8 of the Criminal Code;\n
 \n (a) There must be two or more persons\n
 \n (b) They must form a common intention\n
 \n (c) The common intention must be toward prosecuting unlawful purpose in conjunction with one another\n
 \n (d) An offence must be committed in the process, and\n
\n (e) The offence must be of such nature that its commission was a probable consequence of the prosecution of such purpose.\n
\n See <i>Okosi v. The State (1989) ANLR 170 SC</i>\n
        \n <b>Accessories after the Fact</b>
 \n By virtue of <i>section 10 of the Criminal Code</i>, a person who receives or assist another who is, to his knowledge has committed an offence in order to enable him escape punishment is said to become an accessory after the fact to the offence. If the offence committed is a felony such a person will be liable to two years imprisonment. <i>Section 519 of the Criminal Code</i> provides thus “Any person who becomes an accessory after the fact to a felony is guilty of a felony, and is liable if no other punishment is provided, to imprisonment for two years”.\n
\n If the offence is a misdemeanour, he will be liable for half of the imprisonment prescribed for the substantive offence. <i>Sections 520 of the Criminal Code</i> provides that “Any person who becomes an accessory after the fact to a misdemeanour is guilty of a misdemeanour, and is liable to a punishment equal to one-half of the greatest punishment to which the principal offender is liable on conviction”.\n
\n Similarly, <i>section 521 of the Criminal Code</i> provides that “Any person who becomes an accessory after the fact to simple offence is guilty of a simple offence, and is liable to a punishment equal to one-half of the greatest punishment to which the principal offender is liable on conviction”. But in the case of murder, the accused will be liable for life.\n
 \n <i>Section 322 of the Criminal Code</i> provides that “Any person who becomes an accessory after the fact to murder is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for life”. In the case of treason, it is still imprisonment for life.\n
\n <i>Section 40 of the Criminal Code</i> provides thus provides that “Any person who
\n (a) becomes an accessory after the fact to treason; or\n
\n (b) knowingly that any person intends to commit treason, does not give information thereof with all reasonable despatch to the President or the Governor of the State or a peace officer, or use other reasonable endeavours to prevent the commission of the offence; is guilty of a felony, and is liable to a imprisonment for life”.
</string>
    <string name="strilia">Strict Liability</string>
    <string name="strilia1">Mens rea denotes the mental element of the offence. Strict liability is an exception to the doctrine of mens rea.\n
\n As a general rule, the principle of strict liability means that a defendant is liable even though there is no fault or negligence on his part. Under this scenario, the prosecution needs not prove the mens rea of the offence in order to secure conviction. This means that the proof of physical element simpliciter suffices as proof of the offence for which liability can attach. Thus in strict liability offences it is enough for the prosecution to prove the actus reus.\n
\n Qualifying words import the need for mens rea into an offence. The word “knowingly” for instance means that the prosecution must prove guilty knowledge. This was the court position in <i>Dosunmu v. Comptroller of Custom and Excise (1956) LLR 41</i>. Hubbard J. pointed out that the Custom Ordinance contained three classes of offence – offences of absolute prohibition to which guilty knowledge is irrelevant; offences in which the prosecution must prove guilty knowledge; and the intermediate class of offences involving mens rea, but where the onus of the proof is shifted on to the defendant to disprove guilty knowledge.\n
\n In strict liability offences it is enough for conviction for the prosecution to prove the actus reus. But there is a class of cases where the accused may be given the chance to prove lack of intention, knowledge or negligence on his part. Such offences constitute an intermediate class of offences between those where strict liability cannot be rebutted, and cases of negligence where the onus of proof is on the prosecution.\n
\n It is pertinent to mention that many strict liability offences are concerned with regulatory offences and the protection of public welfare, e.g. food and drug offences, public nuisance, sanitary offences, counterfeits and fake drug offences, contempt of court, etc. The prosecution does not need to prove mens rea to secure conviction in strict liability offence.\n
\n However, strict liability offences are not restricted to regulatory or minor offences alone. In effect, the concept of strict liability is recognised in criminal contempt of court. By <i>section 1(1) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981</i>, someone may be guilty of contempt regardless of intent especially where the publication in question creates a substantial risk of serious prejudice or impediment to a particular proceedings and those proceedings are active.\n
\n At times strict liability may approximate to liability for negligence because sometimes an accused may fail to exercise reasonable care. It must also be mentioned that even sometimes someone may be strictly liable even if he exercises reasonable care and still infringe on the law. In <i>R. v. Champ (1973) Crim. App. R. 367</i>, the Court of Appeal held that the crime of cultivating cannabis was a strict liability offence. This is in spite of the fact that it is punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment.\n
\n <b>Historical Background</b>
 \n The concept of strict liability offences has been in existence since 19th century. It evolved from being the rule in English criminal law to becoming an exception to the doctrine of mens rea due to the combine influence of Roman law and common law principle of English scholars in the middle age. English law recognises some offences for which liability was strict. According to Professor Sayre “in seeking to determine the part played by intent in early criminal law, one must guide against drawing two sweeping conclusions from evidence which is admittedly extremely meagre”. What the recorded fragment of early law seem to show is that criminal intent was not always essential for criminality. But it also appear that even in the very earliest time the intent/mental element could not be entirely disregarded and at least with respect to some crimes “worse of importance in determining criminality as well as in fixing punishment”.\n
\n Historically, the earliest case in which liability was held to be strict was the case of <i>R. v. Woodrow (1846) 15 NRW 404</i> where a licensed tobacco dealer was convicted of having adulterated tobacco in his possession even though he bought the tobacco in good faith, unaware that the tobacco has been adulterated in the course of manufacturing.\n
\n It is pertinent to mention that though there is a general presumption that mens rea is an essential ingredient in every offence, that presumption can be displaced either by the words of the statute creating the offence or by the subject matter with which it deals, and both must be considered. In other words, some offences are strictly created by statute as strict liability offences when such activities are of such obvious danger to the community. To sustain conviction for this type of offences the prosecution need not prove the mens rea of the offence\n
\n In <i>R. v. Prince (1975) </i>, the conviction of a man who took the girl knowingly out of the possession and against the will of her father but reasonably believed her to be over 16 was affirmed. The offence was held to be one of strict liability.\n
\n <b>Strict Liability Offences in Nigeria </b>
\n As stated earlier, offences are classified as strict liability offences where the prosecution need not prove the mens rea of the offence in order to secure a conviction.\n
\n Without doubt strict liability offences exist in Nigeria but the principles governing it are not on all-fours with the one in England. The common law presumption of mens rea and its exceptions are not applicable in Nigeria. The principles governing the physical and mental elements of crime in Nigeria are statute based and may be extracted upon a true construction of the words of the law creating the offence.\n
\n Offences in Nigeria are statute based. Under the Nigeria Criminal Code most offences are defined in terms of specific mental element. Qualifying epithet (description/appellation) such as intentionally, wilfully, unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly, maliciously, are employed to denote the requisite mental elements or attitude (proof of mens rea) in respect of the offence.\n
\n However problem lies in those offences for which no clear and express mental elements are discernible in the definition section creating the offence. By the provision of <i>section 248 of the Criminal Code, </i>any person who sells or has in his possession for the purpose of sale any matches made with white (yellow) phosphorous or uses white (yellow) phosphorous in the manufacture of matches is guilty of an offence and liable. Under this section the selling or possession of white phosphorous match is all that is prima facie required to establish this offence\n
\n Strict liability offences in Nigeria are found in the areas of traffic offences, food and drug offences, contempt of court, statute offences such as Custom and Excise Management Act, Road Traffic Regulation Act, Environmental Sanitation Act, National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC), are some of the strict liability offences created by statute.\n
\n Some penal statutes have also created offences of strict liability include <i>section 3(2) of the Counterfeit and Fake Drug Act, section 16(4) of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) Act</i>. In short in a nutshell strict liability offences are not meant to punish the vicious will of the people but to put pressure on the thoughtless and inefficient to do their duty in the interest of public health and safety.\n
\n <b>Justification for Strict Liability Offences</b>
\n According to Mike Molan et al in their book “Modern Criminal Law, 5th ed” there are several other reasons why the court should recognise strict liability offences. Accordingly, Mike Molan concludes thus:\n
\n 1. For the protection of the public welfare. Certain activities must be prohibited in the interests of public welfare. Activities likely to harm the society must not be allowed.\n
\n 2. It helps to cover offences that are regulatory in nature\n
\n 3. It helps to ensure that citizens are secured.\n
\n 4. To ensure that citizens are held to high standard of practice. Strict liability offences keep people on their toes and in this way ensure high standard than would otherwise prevail. The effect of this is that activities likely to harm the society are put to proper check\n
\n 5. It also helps in speedy dispensation of justice and thus avoiding delay in the criminal justice system. Without strict liability offences many of those charged with such offences would plead not guilty and the prosecuting authorities have neither time nor the personnel to litigate each case through the courts in the face of a large number of such pleas. This would also lead to additional cost to the prosecuting authorities.\n
\nFinally, in spite of diverse views on the need for strict liability offences, there remain some utilitarian justifications for retaining the concept of strict liability especially in the area of public welfare and regulatory offences.\n

</string>
    <string name="defence">Defences to Criminal Responsibilty</string>
    <string name="defence1">Literarily, criminal responsibility means liability to suffer or pay compensation in certain eventualities. Criminal responsibility is defined in section 1 of the Criminal Code as “liability to punishment as for an offence.” The criminal code had laid down certain circumstances in which a person who breaks the law and ordinarily ought to be punished should not legally be held accountable. The reason may be that the person lack the mental capacity, he is excused by law, his conduct constituting the offence is justifiable or by reason of his status, position or office of other grounds.\n
\nDefence to criminal responsibility is concerned with the circumstances under which a person who has committed an offence is adjudged not to be criminally liable. In other words, what factor exculpates a person who would ordinarily be guilty of an offence?\n
\nThe defences are discussed below.\n
\n<b>Mistake – section 22</b>
\n The general principle is that “no liability without fault.” According to the doctrine of mens rea, where an accused is unaware of the facts bringing him within the definition of an offence, there is no legal fault, (i.e. he is not criminally liable). Clearly the most effective way of proving this lack of awareness is for the accused to show that he thought otherwise because he had made a mistake.\n
\nMistake as a defence to crime can be categorised into two kinds: mistake of fact and mistake of law.\n
\n<b>Mistake of law – section 22 CC.</b>
\n A law is a body of rule for regulating human conduct. It is a command which obliges a person or persons to act or to refrain from an action. The rule is that ignorance of law does not excuse. This is expressed by the maxim “ignorantia leges non excusat”. Section 22 CC provides thus: “Ignorance of the law does not afford any excuse for any act or omission which would otherwise constitute an offence, unless knowledge of the law by the offender is expressly declared to be an element of the offence” – in this case, the insane and immature may escape liability because they have no capacity to understand the law\n
\nThe courts are understandably reluctant to recognise mistakes of law as providing any form of defence to criminal charge. See <i>R v. Lee (2000) NLJ 1491</i>
\nThere is no defence if the accused consulted a lawyer who stated that their activity was not a crime, where in fact, it was. Thus, <i>in Shaw v. DPP (1962) AC 22 (HL)</i>, the defendant wanted to know whether publishing a list of prostitutes and their services, the ladies directory, was lawful. The House of Lords held that they were guilty of conspiracy despite the legal advice that they had been given.\n
\n <b>Mistake of fact – section 25 CC. </b>
\nMistake of fact is mistaken belief in the existence of any state of things. A fact is a thing or action performed or an incident that transpire. A fact means that which actually occurred as opposed to mere supposition or opinion. It is the actual occurrence or existence of which is to be determined by evidence.\n
\nSection 25 CC provides that a person who does or omits to do an act under an honest and reasonable, but mistaken, belief in the existence of any state of things is not criminally responsible for the act of the omission to any greater extent than if the real state of things had been such as he believed to exist. In <i>Aiguokhian v. The State [2004] 7 NWLR (Pt. 873) 565</i>, it was held that where an accused person acted under an honest and reasonable belief in a given state or situation which if true would have justified the act, he may set up such credible defence of mistake\n
\nAs opposed to mistake of law, the rule here is that mistake of fact excuses. This is expressed in the maxim, ignorantia facti excusat. Mistake of fact means that the person did not know what the true fact is. The mistake here must be honest and reasonable. This double requirement is not merely repetitious. It must not have been stage-managed.<i>Ogbu v. R. (1959) NRNLR 22 at 24-25</i>\n
\n<b>Bona fide claim of right – section 23 CC </b>
\nClosely related to the defence of mistake is the defence of claim of right. It is a defence in a charge in respect to an offence relating to property, for the accused to show that he was acting with respect to any property in the exercise of an honest claim of right and without intention to defraud. Section 23 CC provides that a person is not criminally responsible, as for an offence relating to property, for an act done or omitted to be done by him with respect to any property in the exercise of an honest claim of right and without intention to defraud\n
 \nThe most important question in relation to this defence is whether it applies only to cases where the accused has got a right to the property in question, or whether it extends also to cases where the accused believes he has right to the property, but in fact has not. Nigerian law tends to favour the broad interpretation. See <i>I.G.P. v. Emeozo [1957] WRNLR 213 (H.C.)</i>\n
\n The defence of claim of right applies only in respect of offences relating to property. Property is defined in section 1 CC as including everything animate or inanimate capable of being the subject of ownership\n
\n<b>Automatism - Section 24 CC</b>
\n Automatism means a behaviour or an act performed in the state of mental unconsciousness or dissociation without full awareness. The term is applied to actions or conducts of an individual apparently occurring without will, purpose or reasoned intention on his part, a condition sometimes observed in persons who without being actually insane, suffer from loss of volition or of memory. Section 24 CC provides a defence where an act or omission is independent of the exercise of the will.\n
\nWhen a man acts in a state of unconsciousness, he is said in English law to have a defence of automatism, a term which can be defined as “unconscious involuntary action” which does not result from a disease of the mind and which is a defence “because the mind does not go with what is being done.”\n
\n<b>Types of automatism </b>
\nAutomatism may be sane as well as insane. While sane automatism is automatism caused by external factors such as a blow on a person‟s head, insane automatism is caused by an internal factor referred to as disease of the mind. Insane automatism is akin to insanity. Whether automatism would be regarded as sane or insane will depend on the frequency with which it occurs. Where it is insane automatism, the implication would be akin to the defence of insanity\n
\n<b>Accident – section 24 CC</b>
\n Accident simply means a sudden or unexpected happening or event which was outside the contemplation of the accused person. It is unexpected, unwilled, unintentional and without any fault as opposed to deliberate, willed or intentional acts.\n
\nThe defence of accident is provided for under section 24 CC and by virtue of that section, a person is not criminally responsible for an event which occurs independently of the exercise of his will, or for an event which occurs by accident.\n
\nIt is an event which a reasonable man in the shoes of the accused would not have foreseen as likely or probable. On this test of objective reasonable foresight, any event which is not reasonably foreseeable whether or not resulting from an existing physical condition such as haemophilia is an accident. Of course, the adoption of the test of the reasonable foresight does not mean that a man escapes liability if he causes an event which he foresaw but which the reasonable man would not.\n
\nIn <i>Amaremor v. The State [2010] 7 NWLR (Pt. 1193) 322</i>, it was held that for an event to qualify as accident, such event must be the result of an unwilled act or an event which occurred without the fault of the fault of the person alleged to have caused it or an event totally unexpected in the ordinary course of events.\n
\n<b>Necessity</b>
\n Necessity entails a choice of evil or duress or circumstances. A defence of necessity avails a person who is faced with an emergency for which he is not responsible and commits harm that is less severe than the harm that would have occurred but for his action. It enables the accused person to escape liability for intentional interference with the security of another‟s person or property on the ground that the wrong complained of was necessary to prevent greater injury to the public or to another or the accused himself or their property.\n
\n<b>Insanity - Section 28 CC</b>
\nInsanity is a defence to criminal liability. This defence is provided for under the provision of section 28 CC. That section provides that “a person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission if at the time of doing the act or making the omission he is in such a state of mental disease or natural mental infirmity as to deprive him of mental capacity to understand what he is doing, or of capacity to control his actions, or of capacity to know that he ought not to do the act or make the omission.” The above provision is impari materia with section 51 of the Penal Code, which provides thus: “Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. There is also a second limb to section 28 CC which has to do with insane delusion.\n
\nIn <i>R v. Iyang (1946) 12 WACA 5</i>, the court held that insanity is manifest or manifest in suffering severe headache, wandering aimlessly at night, wearing shoe or sock only on one leg, laughing uncontrollably, throwing away food to invisible people, and talking to oneself continuously (extensive soliloquising), etc.\n
\n There are two ambits to insanity; insanity before the trial, and insanity during the trial. Insanity at the time of trial is not the same thing as insanity at the time of the commission of the unlawful act. As a matter of fact, these are two different things.\n
\n1. Insanity before his trial: under this circumstance, the accused is said to be incapable or unfit to plead. Insanity at the time of the unlawful act is what the law requires to exempt an accused from the consequence of his act.\n
\n2. Insanity during his trial: when a person is insane during trial, he is said to be incapable of standing trial. When an accused is adjudged to be insane during trial, it means that the accused person is suffering from mental disease or natural mental disorder. Having once established the mental disease or natural mental infirmity, the defence must then show that it was such as to deprive the accused of any of the three different capacities. That is:\n
\n a. Capacity to understand what he is doing: a person may know what he is doing, e.g. he may be aware that he is striking a knife into someone, and yet he may not understand what he is doing\n
\nb. Capacity to know that he ought not to do the act or make the omission: a man may fully understand the nature of his act but prevented by his mental disease or infirmity from knowing that what he is doing is contrary to the law\n
\nc. Capacity to control his actions: even though the accused may understand what he is doing, and even though he may also appreciate that he ought not to do it, yet he may still raise a defence if he can show that his mental disease or infirmity was such that it deprived him of capacity to control his actions. It allows a defence if it can be established that the accused was acting under an irresistible or uncontrollable impulse, although incapacity to control actions is not limited to cases of impulse.\n
\nInsane delusion is defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary to mean a conception of a disordered mind which imagines facts to exist of which there is no evidence and belief in which is adhered to against all evidence and argument to the contrary and which cannot be accounted for on any reasonable hypothesis.\n
\nIn <i>R. v. Grumah (1957) 2 W.Af.L.R. 255 (Gambia case)</i>, the West African Court of Appeal adopted the phrase of a witness that a delusion is “a symptom of mental disturbance and a false belief which is unshakable by facts.”\n
\n<b>Disease of the mind </b>
\nDisease of the mind has been said to be any mental disorder which has manifested itself in violence and is prone to recur. It is important to note that it is not every defect of reason that can sustain the defence of insanity. The defect of reason must be caused by a disease of the mind, it must not be self-induced. It must be natural. Where an accused decide to get intoxicated and by reason of such intoxication begins to strike everyone on the road as he imagines that they were holding guns and want to shoot him, he cannot rely on insanity, rather he can only plead self-defence.\n
\nThe burden of proof\n
\nBy virtue of section 27 CC, every person is presumed to be of sound mind and to have been of sound mind at any time which comes in question until the contrary is proved. The burden of proof of insanity is on the defence.\n
\nThe burden of proving incapacity to make a defence is likewise on the defence, in view of section 27 CC. In English law the quantum of this onus is the same as the quantum when proving insanity as a defence. In <i>R. v. Podola (1960) 1 Q.B. 325</i>, the accused had been indicted for murder. He claimed that he was unfit to plead owing to loss of memory of events prior to and at the time of the alleged homicide. The jury found that his memory loss was not genuine and he was eventually found guilty of murder.\n
\n<b>The consequence of a successful plea of insanity</b>
\n By the provision of section 229 of the Criminal Procedure Act (hereinafter referred to as CPA), an insane person is described as being acquitted. Thus, a successful plea of insanity leads to a verdict of “not guilty” by reason of insanity.\n
\nIn effect, when a person is adjudged “not guilty” by reason of insanity, the following will happen:\n
 \n1. The accused may be locked up at the pleasure of the Governor\n
\n2. He may be given supervised medical treatment\n
\n3. Sent to a psychiatric for care.\n
 \n<b>Diminished Responsibility</b>
\n Diminished responsibility is applicable only in murder trials. It simply means ordinarily the person is not a murderer; maybe he was labouring under intense pressure or undergoing social stress which made him act the way he did.\n
\n<i>Section 2(1) of the 1957 Homicide Act</i> defines diminished responsibility as “such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing.”\n
\n<b>Intoxication - section 29 CC </b>
\nThe rules governing intoxication are stated in section 29(1)-(5) CC and section 52 Penal Code. Section 29(1)-(5) CC provides thus:\n
 \n1. Save as provided in this section, intoxication shall not constitute a defence to any criminal charge.\n
\n2. Intoxication shall be a defence to any criminal charge if by reason thereof the person charged at the time of the act or omission complained of did not know that such act or omission was wrong or did not know what he was doing and –\n
\n(a) The state of intoxication was caused without his consent by the malicious or negligent act of another person: or\n
 \n(b) The person charged was by reason of intoxication insane, temporary or otherwise, at the time of such act or omission.\n
\n 3. Where the defence under the preceding subsection is established, then in a case falling under paragraph\n
\n(a) thereof the accused person shall be discharged, and in a case falling under paragraph (b) sections 229 and 230 CPA shall apply. By the provisions of section 229 CPA, an insane person is described as being acquitted.\n
\n4. Intoxication shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the person charged had formed any intention, specific or otherwise, in the absence of which he would not be guilty of the offence.\n
\n5. For the purpose of this section, “intoxication” shall be deemed to include a state produced by narcotics or drugs.\n
\n<i>Section 52 Penal Code</i> provides thus: “Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication caused by something administered to him without his knowledge or against his will, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.”\n
\nThe general rule is to the effect that intoxication is not a defence to a criminal charge. Section 29(1) CC provides that intoxication shall not constitute a defence to any criminal charge. Similarly, section 44 of the Penal Code provides that a person who does an act in a state of intoxication is presumed to have the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated.\n
\n<b>Exceptions</b>
\n It is imperative to mention that the general rule that intoxication is not a defence to a criminal charge is subject to certain exceptions. Intoxication is a defence if: 1. Intoxication is caused by the negligent act of another (i.e. involuntary intoxication) 2. The person charged was by reason of intoxication insane temporarily or otherwise at the time of such action or omission.\n
\n<b>Intoxication and mens rea </b>
\nThe general principle of criminal responsibility is that for an offence to be constituted, two elements must be present, the physical element and the mental element. While the physical element is called the actus reus which means the guilty act, the mental element is called the mens rea which means the guilty mind. Thus, the actus reus and the mens rea must coexist before it can be said that an accused person has committed an offence. It has been noted that intoxication will provide a defence only when it negatives the required mens rea, and even here the defence is severely restricted.\n
\nAn intoxicated or drugged intent is still an intent. In other words, a drugged intent does not constitute a valid defence because the accused had already formed the intent before taking the drug. The rule is that if the defendant actually has the mens rea of the crime, then intoxication would not be a defence.\n
\nCrimes of basic and specific intent It has been argued that even where intoxication means that the accused lacks the mens rea of a crime, in some circumstances they can still be held liable, forming an exception to the rule that both the actus reus and the mens rea must coexist at one and the same time before an offence is committed. Except where this is the case, the physical element and mental element must coexist at  one and the same time before an offence is committed. In this respect, the court distinguishes between crimes of basic intent and crimes of specific intent.\n
        \n<b>Types of intoxication</b>\n
        \n<b>Voluntary intoxication</b>
 \nThis type of intoxication is self-induced. Voluntary intoxication results from the intentional taking of drink or a drug knowing that it is capable in sufficient quantity of having an intoxicating effect. Voluntary intoxication whether under the Criminal Code, the Penal Code or the common law is not a defence to criminal responsibility.<i> Section 44 of the Penal Code</i> provides thus: “A person who does an act in a state of intoxication is presumed to have the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated.” Voluntary intoxication can at best afford a defence only if it negatives the mens rea required of the offence. It can be no defence if it causes the accused to form the necessary mens rea. <i>Chutuwa v. The State (1954) 14 WACA 590</i>\n
        \n<b>Involuntary intoxication</b>
 \nInvoluntary intoxication occurs when a person without his knowledge or consent has his drink laced with alcohol or other chemical substances capable of intoxicating the innocent party. Involuntary intoxication provides a valid defence to criminal charge. However, where the defendant voluntarily takes alcohol not knowing the potency of the alcoholic content, he would be liable for any crime committed under such influence of alcohol.\n
\nFor the defence of involuntary intoxication to avail an accused under the Criminal Code therefore, he must prove disability and show that:\n
\ni.	The state of intoxication was caused without his consent, and\n
\nii.	That it was caused by the malicious or negligent act of another person\n
        \n<b>Immaturity – section 30 CC</b>
 \nImmaturity has to do with a person‟s capacity to understand what he is doing, giving his particular age and exposure. The law exempt some category of persons from criminal responsibility by virtue of their age. For the purpose of responsibility, people are divided into three age-groups and this is provided for under section 30 CC. That section provides: A person under the age of seven years is not criminally responsible for any act or omission.\n
\nA person under the age of twelve is not criminally responsible for an act or omission, unless it is proved that at the time of doing the act or making the omission he had the capacity to know that he ought not to do the act or make the omission.<i>Watters v. Lunt (1951) 2 All E.R. 645</i>\n
        \n<b>The Juvenile Court</b>
 \nChildren and young persons under the age of seventeen are dealt with in special juvenile courts by virtue of section 6 of the Children and Young Persons Act of 1946. Juvenile courts are held in rooms different from ordinary court rooms. The public are not generally admitted. There is no publication of the identity of the child or young person. The word “conviction” and “sentence” are not to be used.\n
\nAlthough no sentence of death can be pronounced against anyone under 17, it was held in <i>R. v. Bangaza (1960) 5 F.S.C. 1</i> that it may be so pronounced against one who has reached the age of 17 at the time of conviction, even though he was well under the age of 17 when he committed the offence.\n
        \n<b>Obedience to a lawful or superior order – section 31-32 CC</b>
\nThere are a number of situations where a person may be forced by circumstances or in consequence of a legal duty to take action which would be unlawful if the law did not make special provisions for such cases. Where a person is responding to a superior order, it will be a valid defence e.g. a hang man\n
        \n<b>Judicial officers</b>
\nSection 31 CC provides thus: “Unless expressly provided otherwise, a judicial officer is not criminally responsible for anything done or omitted to be done by him in exercise of his judicial function, even though the act done is in excess of his judicial authority, or even though he is bound to do the act omitted to be done.”\n
        \nIn English law, no action civil or criminal lies against a judge of a superior court in respect of any act done by him in his judicial capacity, even though he acted maliciously. This is otherwise called „judicial immunity‟. It is the absolute protection from civil liability arising out of the discharge of judicial functions. This immunity exempts judicial officers from personal actions for damages arising from the exercise of their judicial functions\n
        \n<i>Section 108(1) of the High Court Act, Cap. 510 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1990</i> provides as follows: “No judge shall be liable for any act done in the discharge of his judicial duty, whether or not within the limits of his jurisdiction provided that he at the time, in good faith believed himself to have jurisdiction to do or order to be done the act in question”.\n
        \n<b>Execution of the Law</b>
        \n By virtue of section 32(1) CC and section 45 PC, there is no criminal responsibility for one who acts or omits to act in execution of the law, e.g. the policeman who arrests an offender does not commit an assault. The case of the public hangman, or the man who carries out a sentence of corporal punishment, is covered by section 254 of the Criminal Code which makes lawful the execution of sentences.\n
        \n<b>Superior Order</b>
        \nBy virtue of section 32(2) CC, a person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission committed in obedience to the order of a competent authority which he is bound by law to obey. But the defence does not avail if the order is manifestly unlawful, and whether an order is manifestly unlawful is a question of law. This rule most obviously applies to soldiers and policemen.<i> Ededey v. State (1972) 1 All NLR (Pt. 1) 15</i>\n
        \n<b>Compulsion – section 32(4) CC</b>
 \nA general defence is provided where anyone commits an act or omission in order to save himself from threatened harm. By virtue of section 32(4) of the Criminal Code, a person is not criminally responsible for an act committed or omitted to be done in order to save himself from threatened harm. This defence is however subject to certain limitations. These include\n
 \n1. The harm threatened must be death or grievous harm, and it must be immediate – presumably if it is not immediate the person threatened has time to seek the protection of the authorities.\n
 \n2. The harm must be to be inflicted upon the person threatened, so that the defence does not seem to extend to the case where e.g. the threat is to be carried out against his small son.\n
\n3. Again, the threat must have been made by some person actually present and in a position to execute the threat – there could be no defence if it were delivered by telephone or letter.\n
 \n4. The person threatened must believe that there is no way of escaping the execution of the threat against him, other than to commit the act in question.\n
\n5. The defence does not extend to the commission of offences punishable with death or in which grievous harm or intention to cause such harm is an element\n
        \n<b>Self Defence – section 32(3) CC</b>
\nSelf-defence is a defence of oneself, family, property, or other persons whom he is under a duty to defend provided that the force used is reasonable and not excessive. Section 32(3) of the Criminal Code Act provides a defence wherever the act committed by anyone is reasonably necessary in order to resist actual and unlawful violence threatened to him or to another person in his presence.\n
\nSelf-defence also includes defence of property. Section 282 CCA provides thus: “It is lawful for any person who is in peaceable possession of a dwelling house, and for any person lawfully assisting him or acting by his authority to use such force as he believes, on reasonable grounds, to be necessary in order to prevent the forcible breaking and entering of the dwelling house, either by night or day, by any person whom he believes, on reasonable grounds, to be attempting to break and enter the dwelling house with intent to commit felony or misdemeanour therein”\n
\nCan self defence by pre-emptive?\n
\nThe answer to this is yes. Self defence must not always be in response to an attack, it could also be justified when it is done in response to an imminent attack. It can be done to prevent an attack even before the attack become real.\n
        \n<b>Husbands and Wives – section 36 CC</b>
\nThe general rule is that neither a husband nor a wife can incur criminal responsibility for doing any act in respect of each other‟s property. Thus, a husband cannot be charged with wilfully setting fire to his wife‟s house. See <i>R. v. Carton (1913) Q.W.N. 8</i>. It is to be noted that the rule applies only to offences against property. A husband can be guilty of assaulting his wife however minor the assault. See <i>Alawusa v. Odusote (1941) 7 WACA 140.</i>\n
\nThere are four important exceptions to the defence. These include:\n
 \n1. The rule applies only to the husband or wife of a Christina marriage. Christian marriage is defined in section 1 of the Criminal Code as a marriage which is recognised by the law of the place where it is contracted as the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of others.\n
\n2. The husband and wife must be living together at the time of the alleged offence. It was held in the English case of <i>R. v. Creamer (1919) 1 K.B.564</i>, that they couples are still living together even if the husband is away fighting in a war, and the wife is living with a lover since in the eyes of the law they were not legally separated.\n
\n3. The defence will not avail when the act is committed by a spouse who “living or deserting” or “about to leave and desert” the other.\n
\n4. There will be no defence where the act is accompanied by an intention to injure or defraud some third party\n
        \n<b>Provocation – section 284 CC</b>
 \nSection 283 CC describes provocation thus: “The term “provocation” used with reference to an offence of which an assault is an element, includes, except as hereinafter stated, any wrongful act, or insult of such a nature as to be likely when done to an ordinary person or in the presence of an ordinary person to another person who is under the immediate care, or to whom he stands in a conjugal, parental, filial, or fraternal, relation, or in the relation of master or servant, to deprive him of the power of self-control, and to induce him to assault the person by whom the act or insult is done or offered.”\n
\nIn <i>Ahluwalia (1992) All E.R. 859</i>, the woman who claimed that she was responding to domestic abuse waited for her husband to sleep and set him ablaze. A defence of provocation was held not to avail her. There was a carefully formulated action.\n
\nFinally, a lawful act cannot be held to be provocative. A doctor who is doing his work by administering treatment to a patient cannot be said to have provoked the patient, for instance, for giving the patient a painful injection.\n
        \n<b>Alibi</b>
\nIt simply means that I was not there at the time of the crime, I was somewhere else. This defence is very common in robbery cases. It is a defence when an accused person states that he was not there at the scene of the crime alleged against him. In raising the defence the accused person is saying that he was somewhere other than the place where the offence was committed or simply that he was not at the scene of the crime.<i>Nunukwe v. The State [2003] 14 NWLR (Pt. 840) 219,</i>\n

    <string name="defpsych">Definition of Social Psychology</string>
    <string name="defpsych1">Like most fields in social sciences and humanities, to provide an acceptable definition of the concept social psychology is not an easy task. This problem is due large to the presence of two factors, viz; the discipline is broad in scope and applicability, and secondly, because of the rapid rate in change in relation to the issues it covers.\n
 \nSocial psychology deals with the complex nature of man which has been described as highly unpredictable. In the words of Rusell Kirk, “Man is the least controlled, verifiable, law-obeying and predictable of all subjects.” They are free to choose their course of action. Human beings as thinking beings can and do invent new forms of behaviour to achieve old ends.\n
 \nSocial psychology is the scientific field that seeks to understand the nature and causes of individual behaviour and thought in social situations. Kendra Cherry defines it as the study of how social influence, social perception and social interaction influence individual and group behaviour.\n
\nMost social psychologists focus mainly on task of understanding how and why individuals behave, think and feel as they do in social situations. Consequently, the field of social psychology entails how people act, think and feel in the context of society\n
\n<b>HISTORY OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY </b>
\nSocial psychology as a discipline is relatively young when compared to other social sciences like Economics, Anthropology, Sociology, Political Science, Public Administration, Geography, Regional Planning, etc. It was not until after the World War II (1939-1945) that researches on social psychology began in earnest. The World War II saw the systematic murder of millions of Jews and other persons belonging to races which the Nazis regarded as inferior. At the trials of the Nazis war criminals in 1946, many of the defendants set up the defence of obedience to superior orders. Even though this defence was rejected on the ground that the laws or orders of Hitler were so inhuman, unjust and so evil that the defendants ought to have refused to obey, however, the horror of the holocaust led researchers to begin to study the effect of social influence, conformity and obedience. It was at this point in time that the United States Government became interested in applying social psychological concepts to influence citizens. Since then social psychology has continued to grow throughout the twentieth century, inspiring researches that have contributed to our understanding of social experience and behaviours.\n
\n<b>THE SCOPE OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY</b>
\n The term “scope of social psychology” refers to the areas covered by the subject matter. The scope of social psychology is very broad; hence it is difficult for scholars and researchers alike to demarcate the boundary.\n
\nSocial science disciplines such as economics, statistics, anthropology, political science, sociology, etc, mainly study behaviour of larger groupings and classifications of people and analyse various behavioural indices  which describes regularities in the specific activities of the people. Social psychology on the other hand is concerned with the very behaviour of man in social setting. Social psychology may therefore be broadly viewed as a social science discipline which deals with human behaviour and interactions in the society.\n
\nThe scope of social psychology ramifies five basic essentials as discussed below:\n
\n1. Identifying and questioning empirical assumptions. Social psychology questions societal assumptions about which behaviours are natural and expected, about who benefits and who loses from existing institutional arrangements, and about how and why those assumptions and institutions differ across cultures.\n
\n2. Imagining and exploring alternatives. Social psychology tries to see how human society can be enhanced by quality social interactions and influences.\n
\n3. Understanding that behaviour has multiple interacting causes. Different reasons may be responsible for different actions\n
\n4. Emphasising the centrality of both individuality and community, and \n
\n5. Recognising social psychology as a form of technology. It involves practical knowledge and not just hypothesis.\n
\n<b>KEY TOPICS IN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY</b>
\nThere are many topics in the field ranging from social influence, social interaction and social perception. Others are discussed below:\n
 \n1. Social cognition: this is concerned with the acquisition, processing, storage and application/utilization of social information. When we meet people for the first time, we do not pay equal attention to all the information about them, rather, we focus on what we view as most useful\n
\n2. Attitudes: this describes how we feel, behave and understand. Researchers have described three core component of attitude thus: affective component, a behavioural component and a cognitive component; often referred to as the ABC of attitude. Attitude describes our disposition towards something; e.g. positive disposition toward reading.\n
\n3. Violence and Aggression: social psychology as a field of study is concerned with understanding why people are engaged in social violence. Social psychologists are concerned with understanding for example why people engage in social vices such as insurgency, militancy etc.\n
\n4. Pro-social Behaviour: researchers often concern themselves with why people help others, as well as why they sometimes refuse to help or cooperate. Pro-social behaviours are those that involve helping and cooperating. On the other hand, antisocial behaviours are those that involve declining to cooperate. Social psychology as a discipline is interested in knowing why people act this way\n
\n5. Prejudices and Discrimination: researchers often concern themselves with knowing why and how people develop these forms of attitudes that most times manifest in behaviour. \n
\n6. Self and Social Identity: social psychology as a field of study is also concerned with social status. This is because the society is classified according to whether a person is an elite or a poor person.\n
\n7. Leadership and Group Behaviour: the emphasis here is how the interactional process between the leader and the followers affects each other\n
    </string>
    <string name="resmet">Research Methods In Social Psychology</string>
    <string name="resmet1">Like any other scientific discipline, social psychology is not immune from scientific inquiry to study human behaviour. Social psychologists utilize scientific method to study social psychological phenomena in an objective, empirical and analytical manner. By employing the scientific method, researchers can see the cause-and-effect relationships and generalize the results of their experiment to larger populations. An understanding of the major research methods used in social psychology will make it easier for students in the discipline to compare the different methods that are suitable for understanding human actions.\n
\n<b>Meaning of Research</b>
\nEtymologically, the term “Research” came from the old French root word “Cerchier” which translates into English word meaning to search or seek. The term research simply means to search again, to repeat a search i.e. “Re-Search”. Research is a methodical investigation into a subject in order to discover facts, to find out more about an event, to take another more careful look at a phenomenon, to subject existing belief to scrutiny. It is posited that research is the act of seeking deeply, carefully, critically, empirically, systematically, conscientiously, thoroughly, thoughtfully, exhaustively and intensively for certainty and reliability\n
\n<b>Meaning of Research Method</b>
\n Research method is the systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of data to answer certain question or solve a problem (Omoyibo: 12). Social psychological research refers to the methods which social psychologists adopt in conducting investigation aimed at understanding the nature of human behaviour. There are many methods which social psychologists utilize in conducting research. However, some of the commonest ones are: Observational method, Case Studies, Experimental method, Survey method, Correlational method and Descriptive method\n
\n<b>Observational Method</b>
\n This is also referred to as naturalistic or field observation. This involves observing people and describing their behaviour. This method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Observation research method involves systematically selecting, watching and recording behaviours of people or other phenomena and aspect of the setting in which they occur for the purpose of gaining specific information. This method can be used both in the lab as well as in the natural environment\n
\n<b>Case Study</b>
\n This is the research that selects one or more objects for study with a view to exploring in detail what such object is made of. Under this research method, there is an in-depth observation of a single individual or group. This can help social psychologist to gain comprehensive insight and knowledge into behaviours or actions that are very rare or even impossible to reproduce in experimental setting (Omoyibo: 14). This type of research provides a more rigorous, richly, precise and detailed account of a process. (Osemwota: 39).\n
\n<b>Experimental Method </b>
\nThis involves some level of control groups in the treatment of those being studied. That is, it is designed alongside some form of scientific control. Thus, in experimental research, the experimenter (researcher) randomly assigns participants to one or two groups: the control group and the experimental group. The control group receives no treatment and serves a baseline. The control group must be same in all respects to the experimental group with the exception of the programme treatment (Ikelegbe: 26). The researcher manipulates the levels of some independent variable in the experimental group and then behaviour of the two groups are observed and compared over the same time period in an attempt to capture the differences in the behaviour attributable to programme both before and after the programme. It is important to state at this juncture that experimental methods are result oriented rather than test oriented.\n
\n<b>Survey Method</b>
\n This is the systematic gathering of information from respondents for the purpose of understanding and/or predicting some aspect of the behaviour of the population of interest. The survey method involves the use of standardized questionnaires, interview or both to gather data on large populations. It includes interviewing or questioning a group of subject about their behaviour.\n
\n<b>Correlational Method</b>
 \nThis method is used by social psychologist to look for the relationships between variables. For instance, a social psychologist might carry out a correlational study to look at the relationship between media violence and aggression. The difference between this type of study and the experimental method is that while this type of study can help determine if two variables have a relationship, unlike the experimental method, it does not allow researchers to determine if one variable causes change in another variable.\n
\n<b>Descriptive Method</b>
\n This method presents a picture or characteristics of the specific details of a situation, social setting (family, group, community, etc.) or relationship with a view to revealing the frequency with which particular events are associated with other event. It is posited that much of the research found in scholarly journals or used for policy decisions are descriptive. The descriptive method describes the phenomena that a social psychologist wants to investigate or examine.\n
\nIt is imperative to mention that the descriptive research does not lend itself to in-depth analysis or hypothesis testing like the case study method; some researchers regard the descriptive method as unscientific. However, a descriptive research design can serve as a first step that identifies important factors, laying a foundation for more-rigorous research.

    <string name="theory">Theories of Social Psychology</string>
    <string name="theory1"><b>Introduction</b>
\n All disciplines have theoretical perspectives with which they anchor their methodological findings, and social psychology is not an exception. Theories give researchers different perspectives through which to look at complicated problems and social issues, by focusing their attention on different aspects of data and providing a framework within which to conduct their analysis. Consequently, theories to the social psychologist provide comprehensive conceptual understanding of human social actions especially how societies work, how organizations operate, and why people interact in certain ways. \n
\n<b>What is Theory? </b>
\nThe word “theory” originated from the Greek word ‘thoros’ meaning a spectator. Theory are sets of assumptions, propositions or accepted facts that attempt to provide a plausible or rational explanation of cause–and-effect relationships among a group of observed phenomena (Omoyibo: 20). A theory is a statement that states the relationship between phenomena and the environment (Osemwota:). Theories are set of propositions or principles that are logically put together or use to investigate and explain social phenomena (Ikelegbe:). A theory is a way of making sense out of a disturbing situation.\n
\n<b>Characteristics of a Good Theory </b>
\nIn the philosophy of science literature there are discussions on what makes a good theory. It is however suggested that every good theory must possess the following characteristics:\n
 \n1. A good theory should be able to explain any observation of phenomenon or result of an experiment\n
\n2. A good theory should be able to describe human behaviour \n
\n3. A good theory should be understandable to the interested lay person\n
 \n4. A good theory should be reasonable so that they can be testable.\n
\n<b>The Social Psychologist and Theory</b>
\n Like any other scientific discipline, social psychology is not immune from scientific theory to study human behaviour. The social psychologist adopts scientific theory in its diagnosis of human behaviour. The interpretation of human behaviour to the social psychologist relies on facts (data) which is the hallmark of science. Every scientific theory starts as hypothesis. According to Merriam Webster Dictionary, a hypothesis is an idea that has not been proven yet. If enough evidence accumulates to support a hypothesis, it moves to the next step known as a theory in the scientific method and becomes accepted as a valid explanation of a phenomenon\n
\n<b>Social Psychological Theory </b>
\nThere are four major theories in social psychology as identified by Kendra Cherry, namely: Socio-Cultural, Evolutionary, Social Learning and Social Cognitive. However, there are others such as those ones borrowed largely from psychological sources. These include Attribution theory, Cognitive dissonance etc\n
\n<b>Socio-cultural Theory</b>
\n The crux of this theory is the importance of social norms and culture and proposes that children learn behaviour through problem solving interactions with other children and adults. Through these interactions, they learn the values and norms of their society. Thus a social psychologists using this perspective might look at how cultural norms and social influence impact social behaviour. The emphasis in the modern socio-cultural perspective is the view that a person’s prejudices, preferences, and political persuasions are affected by factors that work at the level of the group, factors such as nationality, social class, and current historical trends.\n
\nAt the centre of this perspective is the concept of culture, which we can broadly define as a set of beliefs, customs, habits, and languages shared by the people living in a particular time and place. Culture includes all the human-engineered features of the environment, from subjective features, such as rules of etiquette, to objective features, such as houses and clothing\n
\n<b>Evolutionary Theory</b>
\n This theory argues that social behaviours developed through genetics and inheritance and emphasizes the role of biology and gene transmission across generation to explain current behaviour. In a nutshell, evolutionary theory asserts that genes govern social behaviour. The central driving force of evolution is natural selection. Both physical characteristics and social behaviours are subject to the process of evolution if they influence the likelihood of individuals passing on their genetic material through reproduction. Thus, when individuals who are healthier and more attractive mate, they will be more likely to have healthy children and pass along their genes. Individuals having those behaviours and physical traits will become more prevalent in the population than individuals lacking those characteristics.\n
\n<b>Social Learning Theory</b>
\n According to social learning theory, people acquire new behaviours through observing and imitating the behaviour of others. Imitation provides another way for people to develop new behaviours. So providing examples of good behaviour to children by acting politely or by exposing them to other children who are polite should encourage them to mimic those behaviours. The theory emphasizes the importance of unique experiences in family, school, community, etc. and established that people learn behaviour through observing and imitating the behaviour of others\n
        \n<b>Social Cognitive Theory</b>
\n This theory states that by understanding how information is processed, we can better understand how patterns of thoughts impart on social behaviour.\n
\nCognitive processes include perception, memory, judgment, problem solving, and decision-making. These cognitive processes may be organized into cognitive structures. One type of cognitive structure is a schema, which refers to a basic sketch of what someone knows about something, and how they organize their understanding of that something.\n
\nCognitive structures may or may not agree with one another. However, the principle of cognitive consistency states that people prefer to have consistent cognitions. If their ideas are inconsistent this tends to cause internal conflict and unease, and the individual is likely to change one or more of their cognitions to become consistent\n
\n1. Attribution theory: this is concerned with the way in which people explain (attribute) the behaviour of others. In social psychology, attribution is the process by which individuals explain the causes of behaviour and events. The development of models to explain these processes is called attribution theory\n
\n2 . Cognitive dissonance: when people do something that violates their view of themselves, this causes an uncomfortable state of dissonance that motivates a change in either attitudes or behaviour. Dissonance is the state of unease or a state of being anxious due to the fact that our behaviour is contrary to our self concept i.e. who we are (Aronson, 1998). Dissonance comes from within; it is how we feel and evaluate our actions and behaviours with what we believe that motivates us to change. This type of attitude change has nothing to do with outside influence. The motivation is to stop this bad or unpleasant feeling leading to attitude and a change in behavior\n
\n3. Drive theory: this posits that the presence of audience causes arousal which creates dominant or typical responses in the context of the situation.\n
\n 4. Motivation crowding theory: this theory suggests that extrinsic motivators such as monetary incentives or punishments can undermine or strengthen intrinsic motivation depending on the circumstance.\n
\n 5. Self-verification theory: this theory focuses on people’s desire to be known and understood by others. The key assumption is that once people develop firmly held view about themselves, they come to prefer that others see them as they see themselves.\n
\n 6. Social exchange theory: this theory views social interaction as exchanges of goods and services among individuals. This theory views people as rational hedonists who will seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs. Social exchange theory argues that people will persist in relationships in which they receive profitable outcomes, and they judge relationships by comparing them to other alternative relationships. In effect, this is an economic theory that posits that human relationships are based on rational choice and cost benefit analysis.\n
\n7. Social identity theory: this theory was developed by Henri Tajfel and examines how categorizing people (including oneself) into in-groups or out-groups affects perceptions, attitudes, and behaviour. When divided into artificial (minimal) groups, prejudice results simply from the awareness that there is an “out-group” (the other group). It states that individuals need to maintain a positive sense of personal and social identity: this is partly achieved by emphasizing the desirability of one’s own group, focusing on distinctions between other “lesser” groups.

    <string name="socint">Social Interaction</string>
    <string name="socint1"><b>Introduction</b>
\n Social interaction is mostly often associated with sociologists. However, because of the nature of social psychology which is the science that anchors its study on the fundamental issues of influence (i.e. how the individual behaviour can affect the others and vice versa); it has become a significant subject matter in the field of social psychology.\n
\n<b>Meaning of social interaction </b>
\nAccording to Erving Goffman, social interaction is the process by which we act and react to those around us. Consequently, social interaction includes those acts people perform toward each other and the responses they give in return. Social interaction has been defined by most scholars as the dynamic changing sequence of social actions between individuals (or groups) who modify their actions and reactions according to the actions of the interacting partners.\n
\n<b>Kind of social interaction</b>
\n Erving Goffman, the major proponent of social interaction indentified five categories of social interaction from a sociological perspective. These includes: Exchange, Competition, Cooperation, Conflict, and Coercion.\n
\n<b>Exchange</b>
\n Exchange is the most basic type of social interaction. Exchange is a social process whereby social behaviour is exchanged for some type of reward for equal or greater value. Whenever people interact in an effort to receive a reward or a return for their actions, an exchange has taken place.\n
\nThis assumption is shared by the social exchange theory which views social interaction as exchanges of goods and services among individuals. The theory views people as rational hedonists who will seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs.\n
\n<b>Competition</b>
\n Competition is a process by which two or more people attempt to achieve a goal that only one can attain. Competition is a common feature of western societies and the cornerstone of the capitalist economic system and the democratic form of government. For example, under the capitalist economic system, individuals are allowed to own and control the means of production in the state. The quest for control of the means of production usually results in competition.\n
\n<b>Cooperation</b>
\n Cooperation is a process by which people work together to achieve shared goals. Cooperation is a social process that gets thing done; no group can complete its task or achieve its goals without cooperation from its members.\n
\n<b>Conflict</b>
\n Conflict is defined as a perceived incompatibility of goals. Conflict can be acted out in several ways. Psychology of politics as a body of knowledge lies somewhere between individual psychology and political science. It deals with the problems of control of behaviour among groups, with the study of organizations of people in conflictConflict can be intra-personal, inter-personal, intra-group, inter-group or between nations.\n
\n Intra-personal conflict is the conflict that occurs within oneself. It arises from being pushed into two or more direction. In effect, when a worker is given two or more different directives by one or two different superiors, such worker is in a state of confusion or bewilderment. At this point, he is said to be at conflict with himself.\n
Inter-personal conflict is a conflict involving two or more persons. It is a disagreement between or among connected individuals who perceive their goals as incompatible.\n
Intra-group conflict refers to conflict between two or more members of the same group or team. Whenever such conflict results, productivity will drop. This means that intra-group conflict has implication on the whole.\n
Inter-group conflict refers to a conflict between different groups. This is the most common type of conflict. This is because groups are generally more competitive and aggressive than individuals. This group may either be competing for value, material resources or for social reward like respect and esteem\n
\n<b>Coercion</b>
\n This is the intimidation of a victim to compel the individual to do some act against his or her will by the use of psychological pressure, physical force or threats. The act of threatening to disclose any secret that would seriously impair the victim’s reputation in the community, thereby forcing the person to yield to one’s demand, is a form of psychological coercion\n
\n<b>YOUNG AND MACK PERSPECTIVE</b>
\n Other social psychologists like Young and Mack identified two kinds of social interaction which are direct and symbolic interaction.\n
\n<b> Direct interaction </b>
\nThis involves physical actions among individuals. For example, beating, biting, killing, boxing, wrestling, etc. are the expression of the direct interaction.  A husband and a wife performing their conjugal responsibility is also an example of direct interaction.\n
\n<b>Symbolic interaction</b>
\n This type of interaction involves the use of language, gesture, symbols, instruments, signs, etc. It means that communication through a common language is a symbolic process. All cultures develop, expand and change only through language. Without language, no culture can live. This implies that there is no culture in animals since there is no common language among them.\n
\n<b>Forms of social interaction</b>
\n There are four basic forms of social interaction, namely\n
\n 1. Social interaction between individual and individual: this is often interaction between two persons. Interaction between doctor and patient, mother and child, guardian and ward, solicitor and a client, all exemplify this form of interaction. This form of interaction is often referred to as dyadic interaction.\n
\n2. Social interaction between individual and group: this is an interaction between one person and a group of persons collectively. A lecturer and his class, an employer and his employees, a commander and his subordinates all typify this form of social interaction.\n
 3. Social interaction between individual and cultures: this form of interaction occurs when people listen to radio, watch television or read newspapers, enjoy pictures and observe exhibitions. By this process, there is a change in the thinking and demand of the people.\n
 4. Social interaction between group and group: this interaction is found between two groups of people like two teams playing match, two forces fighting against each other, two delegates discussing an issue, two families by way of marriage, two schools in a debate competition, etc.\n
\n<b>Importance of social interaction </b>
\nSocial interaction is important for the following reasons\n
\n 1. The opportunity of interacting with others is very important for the development of every individual.\n
\n 2. Through social interactions, people begin to establish a sense of “self” and to learn what others expect from them \n
\n3. Social interactions help children to learn appropriate behaviours such as sharing, cooperating and respecting the property of others.\n
 \n4. While interacting with their peers, young children learn communication, cognitive and motor skills. \n
\n5. Social interaction influences what we do. It influences our actions to a great extent and thus becomes an important cause of our acts.\n
\n 6. Social interaction is the source of human cooperation. It is through social interaction that we come to know how to organize our actions in relations to others so that we can achieve our goals.\n
7. Social interaction helps to create social patterns where interaction becomes organized, rule bound, less spontaneous, more structured and predictable\n

    <string name="aggr">Aggression</string>
    <string name="aggr1">Since the day of yore, aggression has been part of human nature. As a matter of fact, aggression is as old as man. It is human nature to be aggressive. A popular evolutionary explanation of aggression is the “beast within” view. According to this view, “survival of the fittest” has bred aggression in human beings. Aggression is one technique among many others that humans use as they strive for mastery of material resources, as well as for respect from others. It is socialization that alters the beast in us as social animals.\n
\n<b>Meaning of Aggression </b>
\nSocial psychologists define aggression as behaviour that is intended to harm another individual who does not wish to be harmed. This means that aggression is an unprovoked attack. It is a behaviour whose immediate intent is to hurt someone. Conflict between two parties often leads to aggression\n
\n<b>Types of Aggression</b>
\nBandura classified aggression into two, viz;\n
 \n1. Instrumental aggression, and\n
\n2. Hostile aggression \n
\n<b>Instrumental Aggression </b>
\nThese refer to those actions aimed at securing extraneous rewards other than the victim suffering, such as where a student steals a pair of tennis shoes out of another student’s locker. They are the type of actions that are used to gain status, power, resources or some other types of results.\n
\n<b>Hostile Aggression</b>
\n Hostile aggression is an action that is used to produce injurious actions rather than gain status, power, resources or some other types of results. Looking at a girl eyeball to eyeball when she does not desire it is a form of hostile aggression.\n
\nAggression can also be verbal or physical. Slinging insults at a boyfriend is definitely, according to our definition, aggression, just as hitting some.\n
 \n<b>Physical aggression</b>
\n Physical aggression is aggression that involves harming others physically, for instance, hitting, kicking, stabbing, or shooting them.\n
\n<b>Verbal or Non-physical Aggression</b>
\n Non-physical aggression is aggression that does not involve physical harm. This includes verbal aggression (like yelling, screaming, swearing, and name calling), and relational or social aggression (which is defined as intentionally harming another person’s social relationships such as gossiping about another person, excluding others from our friendship, or giving others the silent treatment).\n
\n<b>Non-verbal Aggression</b>
\n Non-verbal aggression occurs in the form of sexual, racial, and homophobic joke and epithets, which are designed to cause harm to the individuals. Non-verbal aggression appear to be more subtle when compare to physical aggression. These include gossiping, spreading rumours, criticising other people behind their back, bullying, etc\n
\n<b>Passive Aggression</b>\n
\n This occurs where a person is not physically involved but gives approval.\n
\n<b>Sources of Aggression </b>
\nAccording to Roy and Judy Eidelson, there are five sources of aggression. These include; \n
\n1. Superiority: this is the belief that one is superior to the other, e.g. soldiers and civilians, Fulani herdsmen and farmers, etc. \n
\n2. Injustice: this concerns the belief that one has a legitimate reason to be aggressive against another. These may more often than not leads to jungle justice. \n
\n3. Vulnerability: this concerns the belief that one could be aggressively defeated or destroyed at the hand of another. Under this circumstance, the vulnerable person may become aggressive by way of self-defence. \n
\n4. Distrust: this occurs where one belief that the other will not honour a promise or commitment. This is the case between Nigerians and the government where citizens believe that politicians are not honest people.\n
\n 5. Hopelessness: this occurs where a person believes that he cannot improve his condition. This can lead to self destruction.\n
\n<b>Social Psychological Theories of Aggression</b>
\n1. Modelling Theory: this theory posits that human beings have the tendency to imitate the aggressive behaviour of others, especially where such behaviour is seen to go either unpunished or rewarded in some ways\n
\n2. Relative Deprivation Theory: this theory contends that a sense of social, economic or political injustice can lead to aggressive behaviour. This theory support Karl Marx prophecy of capitalism as carrying the seed of its destruction. According to him, there is always a class struggle between the bourgeoisies and the proletariats. To him, the proletariat are conscious and always set to mobilize whenever they feel exploited by the bourgeoisies. Further that the bourgeoisies would lose their wealth to the violent of the people\n
\n 3. Deindividuation Theory: this theory contends that people tend to act aggressively when they are in the crowd compare to when they are alone and can be identified. Thus, during group protest, individuals who ordinarily would not harm a fly could turn violent and start smashing motor windscreen, an action he would ordinarily not take when he is alone or where he feels he will be known.\n
\n<b>Conclusion </b>
\nThere is aggression because we live together. Without the coming together of people or group, there would be no aggression. As long as human continue to live together, aggression will remain with man. By understanding where our desire to feel pain comes from, we are given insight into controlling our aggressive and violent tendencies or behaviours. The solution to aggression in our contemporary world is diplomacy.

    <string name="groupdyn">Group Dynamics</string>
    <string name="groupdyn1"><b>Introduction</b>
\n Groups are important in our every day existence. Man is born into a group, play in groups, work in groups, and learn in groups. A group is not simply a collection of individuals who happen to be at the same place at the same time. Rather, to the social psychologist, the term group is much more than that. In the context of social psychologist, groups have special social and psychological characteristics that set them apart from collection of aggregate of individuals.\n
\n<b>Meaning of Group</b>
\n A group dynamic is the aggregation of individuals (two or more) who interact with each other and who mutually influence each other through social interaction.\
\n<b>Characteristics of a group</b>
\n A true group has the following characteristics:\n
\n 1. Interaction and mutual influence: this is manifested through social interactions\n
\n2. A group typically has a purpose: that is, a reason for existing \n
\nChandi Smriti (2015) identified some other characteristics of a group in addition to those itemized above. These include:\n
 \n1. A group must consist of two or more persons: if it is one person, it is not a group.\n
\n2. Formal social structure: the rules of the game are defined\n
\n3. Common fate: they will swim together. \n
\n4. Common goals: the destiny is the same and emotionally connected\n
\n5. Face-to-face interaction: they will talk with each other \n
\n6. Interdependence: each one is complimentary to the other. \n
\n7. Self-definition as group members: what one is who belongs to the group \n
\n8. Recognition by others: other members of the group recognise that you indeed belong to the group\n
\n<b>Classification of groups</b>
\n According to Krech Et al (1962), there are two broad classifications of groups, namely:\n
\n1. The psychological groups, and \n
2. The social groups (also known as social organization) \n
\n<b>The psychological groups</b>
\nThese are groups in which relations among members are interdependent, with each member’s behaviour influencing the behaviour of each of the others, and in which members share a common ideology, a set of beliefs, values and norms which regulate their mutual conduct\n
\n<b>The social groups </b>
\nThe social groups, also known as social organizations are broader than the psychological groups. This is usually a combination of interrelated psychological groups formed to accomplish a stated objective. Social organizations are patterns of coordination that arise implicitly (not formal) out of the interactions of people without involving rational coordination for the achievement of definite common goal.\n
\nAccording to Dokpesi (2006), a good example of social organization is a typical university community in Nigeria where you have a combination of such psychological groups like the local unions such as; friendship cliques on the part of both the students and the workers, clubs, youth gangs like the secret cults, etc. However, the simplest classification of groups was the one provided by Charles Horton Cooley (1902). He divided groups into two, namely;\n
\n1. Primary Groups, and\n
\n2. Secondary Groups\n
\n<b>Primary Groups </b>
\nAccording to Charles Horton Cooley, primary groups are simply small and characterised by intimate, face-to-face relationship and cooperation. It is a group to which individuals closely identify with on a daily basis\n
\n<b>Secondary Groups </b>
\nTo Charles Horton, secondary groups are usually large, formal and impersonal in relationships in which there is little social intimacy or mutual understanding among members. Examples of these groups would include:ASUU, NASU,SSANU and the Students Unions, management team, friendship groups, etc.\n
\n<b>Meaning of Group Dynamics</b>
\n According to the Encyclopaedia of Social Psychology, group dynamics are the influential actions, processes and changes that take place in groups.\n
.\nGroup dynamics concern how group form, their structure and process, and how they functions.\n
\n<b>Characteristics of Group Dynamics</b>
\n Like groups, group dynamics are characterized by the following features:\n
\n 1. Common motive or common goal and share attitudes \n
\n2. A hierarchical group structure that has clearly defined role for each member 3. Standard norms of behaviour and influence of interaction with each other.\n
\n<b>Types of Group Dynamics</b>
\nAccording to Chand Smriti (2015), there are two types of group dynamics, namely;\n
 \n1. Formal groups, and\n
\n2. Informal groups\n
\n<b>Formal groups</b>
\n An organization creates and maintains formal groups to fulfil needs or tasks that are included in its mission or organizational goals. In other to achieve its ultimate goals, an organization creates sub-goals which it assigns to different units or department. These formal groups (units or departments) created by the organization itself are regulated by the organizational rules and regulations.\n
\n<b>Informal groups</b>
\n Informal groups are created voluntarily and spontaneously due to the sociopsychological forces operating in the workplace. They are patterns of coordination that arise among members of a formal organization which are not called for by the blueprint of the organization (that is, they are not part of the organization plan). Informal groups are formed as they satisfy the social needs of individuals while at work. Thus any activities which are not within the scope of the organization are referred to as informal. Because human beings are social animal, they want to interact with other workers who are not in their line, they may also want to have lunch together, to share gripes about their jobs and boss, and in various other ways establish relationships above and beyond the formally required ones. Such relationships tend to arise in all formal organizations\n
\n<b>Importance of Group Dynamics</b>
\n There are several needs or importance of group dynamics. Some of these include by not limited to; \n
\n1. The group can influence the thinking of its members through interactions of other members of the group.\n
\n 2. A group with a good leader performs better when compared to a group with weak leader. This is why it is often said that a herd of sheep led by a lion will defeat a herd of lions led by a sheep. This emphasises the importance of leadership to a group. \n
\n3. The group can give the effect of synergy, that is, if the group consist of positive thinkers, then its output will be more than double every time. Little wonder, the Bible says that one will chase a thousand, while two will put ten thousand to flight.\n
\n4. Group dynamism can give job satisfaction to the members. \n
\n5. The group can also bring team spirit among members. Team spirit brings about increase productivity. Little wonder the term “team” has been used to mean “Together Everyone Achieve More” - T.E.A.M. \n
\n6. Even the attitude, perceptions, and ideas of members depend on group dynamism. For example, the negative thinkers can be converted to positive thinkers with the help of the facilitator who must also be a positive thinker.\n
\n7. If the group work as a cohesive group, the cooperation and convergence can result in maximization of productivity. \n
\n8. Lastly, group dynamism can reduce the labour unrest and labour turnover due to emotional attachment among the group members.\n
\n<b>Conclusion</b>
\n It is important to conclude on the note that group and group dynamism are critical factors in human existence. This is especially so because everything about life borders on social interactions. The five most significant social institutions in society (the family, educational, religious, economic and political institutions) revolve around man and existence.\n
</string>
    <string name="social">Socialization</string>
    <string name="social1">Socialization is defined as the process by which we acquire our social identities and internalize the values, norms, statuses, and roles of the social world. Socialization can also be defined as the process whereby people learn the attitudes, values and actions appropriate to individuals as members of a particular culture. This process of social learning is often acquired by the process of socialization.\n
\n<b>Types of Socialization</b>
\nFrom the social psychology perspective, there are five forms of socialization, viz;\n
\n1. Primary socialization\n
\n2. Anticipatory socialization\n
\n3. Developmental socialization\n
\n4. Reverse socialization\n
\n5. Re-socialization\n
\n<b>Primary Socialization</b>
\n This is the type of socialization which occurs during the early year of life. This includes teaching of language and other cognitive skills.\n
\n<b>Anticipatory Socialization</b>
\n This type of socialization is concerned with the kind of learning which is directed toward one’s future rule. This could be as a college student, trade school student, law school student, international studies and diplomacy student as well as an apprentice.\n
\n<b>Developmental Socialization</b>
\n This is a situation where a new form of learning is added to and blended with an old one in a relatively smooth and continuous process of development.\n
\n<b>Reverse Socialization</b>
\n This type of socialization takes place where the younger generation transfers knowledge to the older generation. It occurs mostly in industrial societies where the pace of technological change is very rapid. A good example of this type of socialization is where children teach their parents how to use computers.\n
\n<b>Re-socialization</b>
\n This involves a sharp break with the past by assuming a new personality. The military is a good example of this type of socialization\n
\n<b>Characteristics of Socialization</b>
\n Socialization differs markedly from society to society with regard to what people become because the values and norms are quite different.\n
\n1. Socialization is an ongoing, life long process or course. Socialization never stops. It continues throughout life.\n
 \n2. Socialization is a critical process. It enables the society to reproduce itself socially as well as biologically. If societies fail in socializing children into accepting societal values, beliefs, norms, institutions, customs, roles, etc. nations and the principles behind it would quickly vanish.\n
\n<b>Socialization and Personality</b>
\n Development Personality is simply an individual’s typical pattern of attitudes and behaviours recognized by the individual and by others. Much of our personality is a reflection of our culture.\n
\n<b>Components of Personality </b>
\nThere are three basic components of personality;\n
\n 1. The cognitive: what we think, perceive and remember\n
\n2. A behavioural component: our abilities, talents and skills\n
\n3. An emotional component: feeling, love, hate, sympathy, anger.\n
\n Charles Horton Cooley said that there are three components of “looking-glass self”\n
\n 1. Our perceptions of how we appear to others\n
\n 2. Our perception of how others judge us\n
\n3. Our feelings about those judgments\n
\n<b>Theories of Personality</b>
\n Two theories of personality development can be identified in this respect\n
\n1. Socio-psychological theory (symbolic interaction theory), and\n
\n2. Psychological theory (psychoanalytic theory)\n
\n<b>Socio-psychological theory (symbolic interaction theory)</b>\n
\n This focuses on human beings interacting in their everyday life. People interact y communicating with each other using symbols which have share meanings. The point is that these shared symbols allow interaction and communication and make socialization possible. Animal communicate, but only humans have language.\n
\n<b>Psychological theory (psychoanalytic theory)</b>\n
\n<b> Freudian Psychoanalytic Model</b>
\nThe Freudian Psychoanalytic Model can also be called the Conflict Model. It was propounded by Sigmund Freud. The Freudian Psychoanalytic Model conceives of the individual as always engaging in a conflictual relationship. This model portrayed primitiveconstant inner struggle between good and evil. For him therefore, individual personal behaviour cannot always be explained Good (i.e. angels) and evil (i.e. devils) were believed to be competing for the domination of the body and soul.\n
\nTo him the major motivating force in human is unconscious in nature. He then used three different constructs/concepts to explain the behaviour of human. These are:\n
\n i. The I.D.,\n
\nii. The Ego, and\n
\niii. The Super Ego.\n
\n<b> The I.D</b>.
\n The I.D. is the core of the unconscious. It is the unleashed, raw, primitive, instinctual drive of the Freudian model. The I.D. constantly struggling for gratification and pleasure is manifested mainly through the libido (sexual urge or sex drive) or aggression. The libido strives for sexual relations and pleasure and also for warmth, food and comfort. Aggression impulses of the I.D. are destructive. It includes the urges to fight, dominate and generally destroy. In a conflict sense, the I.D. incorporates life instincts that compete with its death instincts. As individuals develop and mature, they learn to control the I.D. but even then, it remains a driven force throughout life and an important source of thinking and behaving.\n
\n<b>The Ego</b>
\n Whereas the I.D. represents the unconscious, the Ego represents the conscious. It is the logical part of the Freudian model and is associated with the reality principle. The ego keeps the ID in check through the reality of external environment. The ego is constituted so that it can interpret reality for the I.D. through intellect and reasons. Instead of raping or stealing, the ego develops instrument behaviours such as dating, and searching for food to satisfy the needs of the I.D\
\n<b>The Super Ego</b>
\n The Super-Ego is the third element in the Freudian model. It came in to reconcile the conflict between the ID and the Ego. It can best be described as the conscience. The super ego as the conscience provides the norms that enable ego to determine what is right or wrong. The incorporation and assimilation of cultural values and morals of a society develop from the conscience. Accordingly, the parents have the most influence on the development of the super ego. This is because cultural values and morals are age-long traditions that must be upheld and the parents have the responsibility to inculcating such values and morals to their children who then pass it to their children and so on.\n
\n<b>The Freudian Model in Perspective (Assessment)</b>
\n Freud`s model is characterized by the conflicting personality construct (ID, Ego, Super-Ego) and unconscious motivation. While the ego concept implies that humans are rational, the ID and the Super-Ego and unconscious motivation give the impression that humans are very irrational. In the Freudian model, behaviour is based on emotion. If an individual is unable to control his ID, such individual will be an aggressive, pleasure seeking risk to the society. Again, if the ID is over checked by the Ego, the individual would be maladjusted and will behave awkwardly in social setting. The person may have an abnormal sex life and be extremely passive. Moreover, if the Super-ego is too strong, the result may be acute worry, apprehension, and guilt\n

    <string name="intoil">Introduction and Discovery of Oil</string>
    <string name="intoil1"><b>Introduction</b>
\n No commodity plays a more vital role in economy of the developing countries of the world than oil and gas. For a nation with enormous oil deposits such as Nigeria, oil is the basis of economic life. Oil exports provide not only a large share of national income, but are also the main foreign exchange earnings. Thus, oil represents a great asset which could potentially provide all the capital necessary for Nigeria economic development.\n
\n<b>Petroleum Defined</b>
 \nThe word ―Petroleum came from Latin which means ―rock oil. It is also mineral oil or rock oil because crude oil is found in rock. It is customarily used to identify two closely related compounds – natural gas (methane) and oil.\n
\n Petroleum or crude oil is a naturally occurring, toxic, flammable liquid consisting of a complex mixture of hydrocarbons of various molecular weights, and other organic compounds, that are found in geologic formations beneath the earth\'s surface.\n
\nPetroleum is a compound mainly containing hydrogen and carbon, and is commonly called hydrocarbon. It can exist in gaseous, solid and liquid form and has weight. When it is found as a solid, it could be coal, shale, tar sands or bitumen. In liquid form it is referred to as crude oil. Hydrocarbons in gaseous form are known as natural gas.\n
\nThe most commonly known hydrocarbon is crude oil which as stated earlier may refer to as petroleum. The lighter a crude oil the more qualitative it is and the higher the demand for it and as such the more commercial value and revenue that accrues from it. On the other hand, the heavier it is the less commercial value, the quality and the demand for it, and as such the less revenue from it. Nigeria has one of the best crude in the world. This is because the oil is light and therefore it is in very high demand.\n
\nHowever, from a technical point of view, the term petroleum covers other types of hydrocarbons. There has also been a statutory definition of petroleum under the <i>Petroleum Act of Nigeria</i> which provides that petroleum means ―mineral oil (or any other related hydrocarbon) or natural gas as it exists in its natural state in strata, and it does not include coal or bituminous shales or other stratified deposits from which oil can be extracted by destructive distillation.\n
\nFurthermore, ―crude oil is defined in the Act as ―oil in its natural state before it has been refined or treated (excluding water and other foreign substances)‖. Natural gas means ―gas obtained from borehole and well consisting primarily of hydrocarbon.\n
\n<b>ENERGY AND THE DISCOVERY OF OIL</b>
\n The importance of petroleum today is due largely to the fact that it is a source of energy. Energy can be said to be the capacity for doing work or something. It can be said to be the force behind every activity. Energy is basically what makes things function.\n
\nWithout energy the wheels of industry will not turn. No cars, trucks, trains, ships or airplanes would be built. Without energy, houses would remain cold and unlighted, food would be uncooked. Without energy resources we would literally be back in the Stone Age. Energy is the underlying factor behind every type of activity or action. For this reason, the development and future of any society is dependent on its ability to have access to the energy it needs. Therefore one finds that the energy consumption of any of the developed countries is several times more than that of the average developing country. For example, the energy consumption of the United States of America is several times more than that of Nigeria because America as an industrialized nation needs energy for production. As a matter of fact, every machine use for production needs energy to function. The gap between the highly developed nations of the world and the less developed depends almost entirely on the relative availability of energy between the two societies.\n
\n<b>Sources of Energy</b>\n
\n The conventional sources of commercial energy include coal, oil, gas, hydro-electricity, nuclear, wind, etc. on the other hand, there are the traditional or non-conventional sources of energy, these include fire wood, animal dung, agricultural wastes, etc. non-conventional sources of energy are those which are gotten from reliable energy forms, such as solar, wind, wave energy or bio-mass (plant and animal waste as fuel)\n
\n<b>HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF OIL</b>
\nIt should be noted that the use of oil has changed over time in the world right from its early discovery through its development to the present age. Oil in general has been used since early human history to keep fires ablaze, and also for warfare. Ancient Persian language tablets indicate the medicinal and lighting uses of petroleum in the upper echelons of their society. Ancient China was also known to burn skimmed oil for light. It was recorded in the bible that it was used to build the ark and the walls of Jericho\n
\nIt will be realized that Drake\'s success in 1859 marked the beginning of the rapid growth of the modern petroleum industry. Soon petroleum received the attention of the scientific community, and coherent hypotheses were developed for its formation, migration upward through the earth, and entrapment. With the invention of the automobile and the energy needs brought on by World War I (1914-1918), the petroleum industry became one of the foundations of industrial society. As the world‘s consumption of oil rises, the quest to have more reserves of oil increased and consequently it has led to more drilling effort by many countries in different parts of the world through the available scientific and technological means.\n
\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the oil industry concentrated on extracting kerosene from crude oil for lamps and stores. In 1870, John Rockefeller and a few associate incorporated the Standard Oil Company which dominated the kerosene market until competitors appeared. Its use as lubricant also began to be developed at this time. However, more important was the development of crude oil as a boiler fuel which soon became competitive with other established energy forms, particularly with coal in locomotives and ships.\n
\nIn 1890, a large oil field was discovered in Russia. During this period advances were made in refining which extended its use as a fuel for car and aero engines. The large-scale  conversion of navies and merchants fleets to oil from coal helped to provide oil with an important boost. As kerosene lamps gained popularity, the refining industry grew in the area. In the first quarter of the 20th century, the United States overtook Russia as the world\'s largest oil producer. By the 1920s, oil fields had been established in many countries including Canada, Poland, Sweden, the Ukraine, the United States, and Venezuela. With this rapid advance, by the 1930s oil began to compete with coal as the chief energy source for the world‘s industries. World consumption of oil rose to about one million barrels a day by 1940.\n
\nHowever, it was during the World War II era that there was much discovery of oil. In 1947, the Superior Oil Company constructed the first offshore oil platform off the Gulf Coast of Louisiana. It was in the post – World War II period of reconstruction and growth ending in the 1960s that oil overtook coal‘s predominant position in world energy consumption with total oil production reaching over 20 million barrels per day.

    <string name="refoil">Refining and Use of Crude Oil</string>
    <string name="refoil1">In a world hungry for oil and gas, oil is being produced in nearly over 80 countries of the world and Africa has emerged as the hotspot for production and exploration of crude oil. The Middle East country has almost 57% of the world crude oil reserved, and Nigeria has emerged as one of the largest producers of crude oil. Also the new discoveries of crude oil in countries like Uganda, Ghana and the Gulf of Guinea (Sao Tome Principe) has continued to make the oil industry very exciting, relevant and futuristically significant especially in Africa.\n
\nUse of oil has continued to expand on the residential and commercial fronts in the United States with more than 26.8 million customers using crude oil for heating in the 1980s. In Nigeria since the 1980s, there has been increasing utilisation of crude in Nigeria, for power generation, industrial heating, fertiliser and petrochemical manufacturing and as feedstock for direct steel production.\n
\nBy itself, oil in its unrefined form has little or no direct use. It only becomes relevant and useful when its hydrocarbon nature is broken and is mixed with other chemicals in a refinery to produce products that can be marketed\n
\nOil in its refined state is useful in many ways such as petrol for cars, otherwise known as Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), aviation fuel, diesel, Kerosene, synthetic rubber, bitumen for roads, tar for ships, medicine, lubricants, grease, jellies. It is safe therefore to say that the value of a crude oil is directly related to the yield of useful products each barrel will produce as it passes through a refinery. Tens of thousands of different products can be derived from crude oil.\n
\nCrude oil and the natural gas are the most important sources of energy in the world today. In general, crude oil once refined, yields three basic grouping of products which are produced when it is broken down into fractions. The valuable top gives the gas and gasoline (sometimes referred to as white products) which is used for domestic purposes, aviation and motor fuels and also as feed-stocks for petro-chemical industries.\n
\nThe middle part gives us kerosene, heating oil, diesel and waxes and lubrication oil, while the lowest part is used for electricity generation purposes, industrial boilers, water proof, bitumen or asphalt used for road construction, and the product for ship furnaces as well as roofing materials.\n
\nThe actual proportions of lights, medium and heavy fractions that exist naturally in a barrel vary enormously from one crude oil to another. For instance, light North African crudes from Algeria or the Libyan Jamahiriya have high yields of light and middle distillates, while heavy crudes may yield almost no light product, with heavy fuel oil and residue accounting for over 80 per cent of a barrel in certain cases.\n
\nHowever, what a refinery extracts from a barrel of crude oil and how it divides the cuts it takes from a barrel depends on its processing facilities and plants known as the configuration which is usually built as far as possible to meet specific demands for particular markets. A refinery configuration is therefore influenced by the specific demands of a market as well as the availability and price of different types of crude oil. A refinery configuration is very expensive with high technology equipment and at the same time very dynamic which can be summed to say it is not a child‘s play. It must be carried out with utmost sense of responsibility.\n
\nA refinery by standard has a life span of up to 20 years. However, by continuous upgrade, it can be made to be viable to the changing or dynamic patterns or crude oil production technology

    <string name="ownpet">Ownership and Control of Petroleum</string>
    <string name="ownpet1"><b>Ownership Defined</b>
\n Ownership has been defined as the right to enjoy or dispose-off a thing in the most absolute manner, i.e. in a manner that cannot be challenged by another person or a third party. Ownership can also be said to comprise of the power of enjoyment, the power to determine the use of a thing, the power to alienate, the power to bequeath by will and the power to charge or use as security.\n
\nOwnership has been described thus: an owner of a thing may grant to another person many or all his rights for a stipulated time period and still remain as owner. Therefore ownership has been regarded as a magnetic coil which remains when all present rights of ownership are removed from it, and which attracts to itself the various elements temporarily held by others as they lapse.\n
\n<b>Control Defined</b>
\n The Black’s Law Dictionary 10th edition defines control as ―the direct or indirect power to direct the management and policies of a person or entity whether through ownership or voting securities, by contract, or otherwise; the power or authority to manage, direct or oversee‖. To control means to have the power to direct something. From this perspective ownership and control are connected.\n
\n<b>Theories of Ownership in Oil and Gas</b>
\n Theories are set of propositions or principles that are logically put together or use to investigate and explain phenomena. Several theories have been put forward as to whether petroleum is capable of being owned\n
.\nBasically, there are three theories of ownership, viz;\n
\n1. Absolute ownership theory\n
 \n2. Qualified ownership theory\n
\n 3. Domanial or Non-ownership theory\n
\n<b>Absolute ownership theory</b>
            \n This theory states that the owner of a piece of land is regarded also as the owner of the petroleum lying underneath the land. Respect as per this theory will be given to the United States in that some of the states allow private ownership of mineral resources in situ. In effect, a person in whose land or property crude oil or other mineral resources is discovered to a great extent is allowed to own it in fee-simple\n
\nThis ownership can however be defeated because of the movable nature of some of these natural resources and since petroleum is gaseous in nature. Once it migrates from a said land to the adjacent land the title of the first owner is lost to his neighbour without his consent and without any liability for this divesture of title by drainage\n
\n<b>Qualified ownership theory</b>
 \nThis theory states that petroleum cannot be owned until it is captured and reduced into possession. In other words, there is no absolute and exclusive title over crude oil which has not been captured or reduced into possession. This theory or system is practiced in California and Indiana in the United State of America, and by the theory, a land owner has no exclusive right or title to the crude oil or petroleum found on his land for the simple fact that he can be divested of the title by drainage without consent and without any liability on the part of the person causing the drainage.\n
\nThe effects of the two theories (absolute and the qualified theories) are similar in practical terms. In both the absolute and the qualified theories the land owner is not in fact entitled to oil and gas beneath his land. What he has are the rights to sink as many wells as he desires subject to good operating practices, and to extract as much oil and gas as he can produce. It is clear that oil is capable of moving from under one piece of land to another. In the case of <b>Barnard v. Monongahela Natural Gas Co. 216, pa.362, 65A. 801 (1906)</b>, the court refused to forbid drilling by an adjacent land owner alleged to be draining oil from a reservoir under the plaintiffs land, holding that the plaintiff remedy was ―‖self help in drilling his own well.\n
\n<b>Domanial or Non-ownership theory</b>
\n The domanial system provides for vesting of ownership rights in the sovereign. Primarily, there is a school of thought that contends that oil cannot be owned by anyone, i.e. there is no ownership by anyone. However, since the land is a part of a sovereign state, the Domanial theory or system vests ownership on the sovereign, i.e. the government of the land or state. Thus, the government becomes the owner and controller of the crude oil found in the land or state by virtue of the principle of quic quid platatur solo solo cedit, which literally means ―whatever is on the land forms part of the land‖.\n
\nNigeria falls within this system of ownership. The vesting of ownership and control of minerals and mineral resources in the Nigerian state is historical and dates back to the colonial era. This has had a great impact on the country‘s legal system and conception of property rights.\n
\nThe Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (CFRN) of 1999, as amended, confers exclusive power on the Nigerian State to own, control and regulate the activities of minerals, mineral oils and by-products. This power is firmly provided for in <b>section 44(3) Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended</b> (hereinafter referred to as the Constitution). This section specifically provides ―Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this Section, the entire property in and control of all minerals, mineral oils and natural gas in, under or upon any land in Nigeria or in, under or upon territorial waters and the Economic Zone of Nigeria shall vest in the Government of the Federation and shall be managed in such manner as may be prescribed by the National Assembly.\n
\nThus, the appointment of the Minister of Petroleum who grants licences and leases over petroleum and generally oversees the industry on behalf of the government lies with the sovereign.\n
\nThe constitution thus excludes the right of any person to own any of these minerals while it has been made the property of the State. This imposition is a major one as it is contained in the basic law of the land. The constitution entrenches this provision of vesting ownership in the State to reinforce similar provisions in other statutes like the Petroleum Act, Economic Exclusive Zone Act and the Land Use Act. As it were these provisions will be very difficult to change or even discarded as such action will have to go through a rigorous amendment exercise of the Constitution.\n
\nIn Nigeria, the ownership of petroleum vested in the Federal Government is not a symbolic one, it is a functional one. By virtue of this power of ownership by the Federal Government, section 2 of the Petroleum Act authorises the Minister of Petroleum Resources to grant licence and leases for the exploration, prospecting and mining of petroleum. Oil companies wishing to explore for petroleum in Nigeria are therefore required to apply for either, for Oil Exploration Licence or an Oil Prospecting Licence or Lease. The fact that ownership of oil and gas in Nigeria is vested in the federal government was established in the case of <i>South Atlantic Petroleum Limited v. Minister of Petroleum Resources (2006) 10 CLRN 122.</i>\n
\nRecently, there has been clamour for resource control by some states in Nigeria. The issue of state ownership of petroleum in Nigeria was clearly buttressed in the case of AG Federation v. AG Abia State &amp; Ors [2002] 6 NWLR (Pt. 764) 542.\n
\n<b>Conclusion</b>
\n The fact that petroleum is capable of being owned is a truism. It is only the form in which it can be owned that has generated a variety of opinions from experts. Each of the theories is subject to peculiar circumstances of the country and the governments who are responsible for the management of the natural resources of that particular country. From a general view oil is capable of absolute ownership while on the other hand it may be said that it is not capable of absolute ownership because of its unstable character.

    <string name="woi">World Oil Industry</string>
    <string name="woi1">Between 1930 and 1970 the world oil industry was mainly controlled by what is known as the seven sisters, i.e. seven main or major International Oil Corporations (IOCs). These seven International Oil Corporations controlled the upstream and downstream activities, they controlled exploration and production, transportation and refining, and the marketing and retailing of products. With all these, they were naturally in control of all aspects of crude oil from its discovery to its becoming a source of revenue. The downstream sector is concerned with the post production stages of oil and gas through the refining and processing states until it passes to the consumer. These seven major International Oil Corporations (IOCs) were able to remain in control because of their well sophisticated and well developed vertical integration of their operation. The seven sisters are British Petroleum – (BP), Exxon, Gulf, Mobil, Royal Dutch or Shell, Standard Oil of California, and Texaco. During this period, the oil owners, i.e. the Host Countries (HC) virtually had nothing to do with the oil than to collect royalties and meagre consideration because they and their government neither knew the value nor the possibilities in the crude oil commodity. They lack the knowledge and were not exposed to its usefulness and most of these oil producing countries were at this time under colonial rule.\n
\nThe seven sisters were able to hold on to the control of crude oil through the operation of what is known as a concession system under which they had virtually control and authority over the entire oil exploration and production in some producing countries. Concession is the grant by a state to a company or a corporate entity for specific privileges. Concession is defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary, 10th edition as ―a government grant for specific privileges...‖\n
\nConcession connotes or implies a relationship between the weak and the strong. The transaction appeared one-sided, between a king who knew very little about the possibilities of the commodities and was too easily satisfied with his royalty of a few gold sovereigns and the oil company, rich, powerful and knowledgeable. The concession was therefore regarded as a transaction in which a monarch ―unmindful of the interest of his people, gave too much for too little, and gave to foreigners who were only too eager to build a colonial system upon the grant‖\n
\nThese companies also known as the ―seven sisters‖ (made up of five U.S. oil companies and two British-based companies) dominated the oil industry for a long time and their operations covered many countries due to their capital and experience. One major thing that also contributed to the expansion of these international oil companies was that it had the support of the governments of their countries at the time, i.e. the United States and Britain. This was the situation of oil and gas that affected the operations in the industry.\n
\nThe concession system operated during the era of petroleum imperialism. The oil producing countries on realising to some extent the values and possibilities embedded in the commodity (crude oil) which has been said to be the single most important world traded raw material, they condemned the practice of the concession system. According to S.K.B. Asante, the concession was an instrument of blatant economic exploitation.\n
\nOne of the features of the concession system was that a crude oil concession grant normally runs for a long duration of time mostly between thirty to forty years (and at times, 100 years as is the case of Ghana experience).\n
\nThe rights granted were sometimes so extensive that they cannot be differentiated from a freehold interest, and the right was usually exclusive ownership of and was free to dispose of them as it deemed fit. These characteristics of the concession were clearly inequitable and lopsided in favour of the oil companies, and therefore, such arrangements were unable to survive decolonization and the ―new international economic order.‖\n
\nIn the late 50s and early 1960s a number of factors came into existence which had a profound cumulative effect on the shape of the world oil industry.\n
\nFirst, there was the appearance or arrival of a large oil companies known as the independents. These companies broke the backbone and the stronghold of the foremost oil companies.\n
\nSecond, there was the appearance of European competitors who came from France and Italy and having as their base United State of America. These companies were established by the government of some European countries and they were ready to exploit small remote areas which helped in giving the oil producing states some leverage, control and revenue.\n
\nThe next event in the oil industry is the establishment of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in September 1960 by the five founding countries, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela. The formation of OPEC can be seen as a response by the oil producing countries most of which were developing countries, to the domination of the system by the foreign oil companies. As a matter of fact, OPEC was formed as a direct response to the challenge posed by the major International Oil Companies (IOCs).\n
\nFinally, there was also the establishment of different national oil companies by the different oil producing countries which added up to their becoming host countries. The establishment of country-based oil companies brought about awareness and exposure of nationals/citizens. It also brought about controlling influence through nationalization and also it brought about new forms of agreement. Nationalization is the legal taking of property of an alien. Nationalization is lawful under international law, albeit with compensation. It also brought about the involvement of host country‘s government in the operation of the both the upstream and the downstream activities of the crude oil industry.\n
\nAs a result of these factors, the major IOCs gradually lost control over direct access to crude oil. In other words, these events lead to the demise of the International Oil Companies which had dominated the world oil industry up to the seventies.

    <string name="noi">The Nigerian Oil Industry</string>
    <string name="noi1">Historically, the Nigerian petroleum scene opened as far back as 1908 when the Nigerian Bitumen Company drilled for oil in Okitipupa in the present Ondo State. This attempt however was not successful but was the pioneering effort at other future attempts at oil exploration in Nigeria. The attempt was said to be unsuccessful because it was not found in commercial quantity. The activities of the company ceased as a result of First World War.\n
\nInterest in the possibility of discovering oil in Nigeria was rejuvenated in 1937 with the establishment of the Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria and was given an oil exploration licence covering the whole of Nigeria by the British colonial government in November 1938.\n
\nIn 1951 Shell-BP drilled its first well but it came up dry. During the next four years the company concentrated efforts in the areas around the Niger Delta in the southern part of Nigeria without discovering well that could produce oil. With continuous effort in the search for oil in these areas for few more years, in 1956, Shell-BP made the Nigeria first commercial discovery at Oloibiri in the Niger Delta area (now Bayelsa State in Nigeria). Toward the end of 1956, another large discovery was made in Afam in Rivers State. By 1958 production of crude oil in Nigeria had reached 5,100 barrels per day, and the first shipment of crude oil was made to Europe. Nigeria was thus ushered into the international oil stage. Since the discovery of oil in Nigeria in commercial quantity, exploration and mining had continued up till the present day.\n
\n<b>The Nigerian Type of Exploration</b>\n
 \nRight To explore in relation to petroleum means ―to make a preliminary search by surface geological and geophysical methods, including aerial surveys but excluding drilling.\n
\nThe exploration of petroleum in Nigeria is regulated by law. These laws have been made for the proper administration of the operation of the oil mining process and the general practice in the oil industry. These exploration rights are examined under the following headings;\n
\n1. Mineral Oil Ordinance of 1914\n
\n 2. Petroleum Act of 1969\n
\n<b>Acquisition of Oil Right under the Mineral Oil Ordinance of 1914 </b>
\nThe Mineral Oil Ordinance was passed in 1914 and was the only law on oil in Nigeria before 1969. The Mineral Oils Ordinance of 1914 was enacted to regulate the right to search for, win and work mineral oils in Nigeria. For any company to have the right to explore or produce oil in Nigeria, it needs the authorization of the government through the Minister of Mines and Power. The authorization given under this ordinance was standardized into three types. These include\n
\na. Oil Exploration Licence – OEL\n
 \nb. Oil Prospecting Licence – OPL\n
\nc. Oil Mining Licence – OML\n
\nOil Exploration Licence\n
\n Exploration is the general process of searching for oil. Oil exploration involves the process of searching for and discovery of oil from its natural source which is usually under the ground. It is the first step in the actual search for oil among series of other steps. Exploration for oil has commenced in many parts of the world for centuries. In various countries and regions attempts have been made to discover oil through the geological means and within the technology available. It is believed that the first oil well is said to have been dug in southern Iran in about 500BC and the Chinese are believed to have drilled for oil and gas with bamboo tubes and bronze drill bits as early as the third century BC.\n
\nAn oil exploration license does not confer any exclusive rights over the area of the licence, and the grant of an Oil Exploration Licence does not preclude the grant of another Oil Exploration Licence or an Oil Prospecting Licence or Oil Mining Lease over the same area or any part therefore. Other companies can also be given the same right of exploration over the same area provided that such area has not been approved for grant or already granted to oil operators under oil prospecting licence or oil mining lease.\n
\nAlthough the right of exploration was not an exclusive right, however under the 1914 Mineral Ordinance, it was restricted to British subject. Thus, <i>section 6(1) of the Mineral Oil Ordinance of 1914</i> provided as follows: ―No lease or license shall be granted except to a British subject or to a British Company registered in Great Britain or British Colony and having its principal, place of business within her majesty‘s dominion, the Managing Director (if any) and the majority of the other director of which are British subjects.‖\n
\nAnother feature of the oil exploration licence is that the area to which such licence applies is usually large and covers both land and water (say 10,000 miles).\n
\n The purpose of this licence is mainly to explore or discover but not to drill or produce oil in the area permitted. However, where oil is found in commercial quantity, an exploration right can be converted into a prospecting licence subject to the approval of the government through the Minister\n
\nOil exploration is usually the first step in the actual search for oil among series of other steps and its licence usually runs for one year duration subject to renewal. As a matter of fact, an oil exploration license terminates or expires on 31 December of the year within which the grant was made. The licensee usually has an option for renewal for one further year upon meeting the following conditions, that is, if:\n
\n1. It has fulfilled in respect of the licence obligations imposed by the Ordinance or otherwise\n
 \n2. The Minister is satisfied with the work done and the reports submitted by the licensee in pursuance of the licence, and\n
 \n3. An application for renewal has been made at least three months before the date of expiration of the licence\n
\n<b>Oil Prospecting Licence</b>
\n This is the next step after exploration. Oil prospecting in strict terms would include the right to explore and carry away and dispose of petroleum won during prospecting operations.\n
\nBy application to the Minister of Mines and Power, an oil company can be given the right or licence for a period of three years initially with an addition of two years extension when it has to do with mainland areas (downstream), and for a period of four years initially with an addition of three years extension where it has to do with continental shelf areas (upstream).\n
\nUnlike Oil Exploration Licence, an Oil Prospecting Licence grants an exclusive right to the company to whom it has been issued to carry out geological and geophysical investigations in their concession areas to drill, export and refine the petroleum in Nigeria. In effect, the holder of an oil prospecting license has the exclusive right to explore and prospect for petroleum within the area of his license. An oil prospecting licence when issued gives the company to whom it has been issued the right to the following:\n
\n1. To carryout geological and geophysical investigation over the area possibly for more discovery\n
\n2. It gives the company the right to drill and produce crude oil from the said area, and\n
\n3. It gives the company the right to export the crude oil and to refine the product.\n
\nA company with an oil prospecting licence has obligation to train Nigerians in the act of drilling and production of crude oil, and on an expiration of an oil prospecting licence the right returns to the government or it can be converted to a mining lease.\n
\nOil Prospecting Licence though looks good but is not beneficial to the Host Countries (HCs) in that the so-called training most of the time is not been carried out. Also the payment being made was too meagre compare to what was being taken to the extent that at a time the payment for rental royalties was as low as 4 shillings over a large quantity of crude oil being drilled.\n
\nOil Mining Lease The Oil Mining Lease is the third type of approval being granted to oil companies for the purpose of exploration and production of crude oil. This right involves actual drilling of the earth surface deep into the ground to locate crude oil deposits. By its nature petroleum is found underground deep inside the earth‘s crust and under the sea beds. But it has to be extracted.\n
 \nAn Oil Mining Lease runs over a mainland area for thirty years (30 years) with the addition of another renewable period of thirty years (30 years), and over a continental shelf for forty years (40 years) with a renewable right of another forty years (40 years). Thus an Oil Mining Lease runs for a long duration of time.\n
 \nAn Oil Mining Lease is an exclusive right for a company to do all that are necessary for the purpose of exploring and producing petroleum to the extent of developing a petroleum industry.\n
\n An Oil Mining Lease covers an area of land as large as can be approved by the government.\n
\n A company with an Oil Mining Lease has an obligation to train Nigerians in the act of drilling and production of petroleum. Similarly, a company with an Oil Mining Lease is expected to make use of experts and up to date equipments in the act of production in order to give effect to the right standard practice.\n
\nAlso the depreciation rate the companies were allowed were higher than normal economic principles. Depreciation in this context connotes the amount of money set aside for equipment to run. It is the deductions made for the purpose of liquidating the cost of equipment. The companies were also allowed to access their profit on the basis of realised proceed and even their royalties and other dues were paid out of fifty percent (50%) profit share of the government. All these were allowed on the excuse of the need to attract or induce oil companies to start exploration and development of petroleum production.\n
\n<b>Acquisition of Oil Right under the Petroleum Act of 1969</b>
\n The Petroleum Act of 1969 came in during the military regime and towards the end of the Nigeria Civil War which lasted between 1967 and 1970. The Act can be said to be the first major attempt of the Nigeria government at providing a detailed law as per the right and obligations of licensees and lessees (that is, under the OEL and OPL licences and the OML lease) of petroleum\n
\nThe Act was a water-shed (turning point) which vested the ownership of oil on Nigeria and is still the most comprehensive law as far as oil and gas in Nigeria is concerned. Although, there have been efforts at given effect to the Petroleum Industry Bill to complement the provisions of the Act which is still in the offing but at the verge of been passed.\n
\nThe Act (the Petroleum Act) specifically in section 1(1) states that the entire ownership and control of all petrol in, under and upon any land to which the section applies shall be vested in the state.\n
\n The Act also in section 2(1) provides that no company shall apply for oil lease or licence until it is made to the Minister of Petroleum (as against the Minister of Mines and Power under the 1914 Ordinance). The Act empowers the Minister of Petroleum to issue a formal written authorization for such licensee and lessee.\n
\nUnder the Petroleum Act there was an increment in fees, royalties, dues and rent being paid by the licensees and the lessees which of course accrue to more revenues being derived from crude oil by the government.\n
\nBy the provision of the Act, an Oil Exploration Licence still operates for one year with another renewable term of one year while an Oil Prospecting Licence operates for a maximum period of five years (5 years) and an Oil Mining Lease for twenty years (20 years) with a subjective renewal possibility in that a lessee must not be found wanting of any obligation expected of him\n
\nAnother issue regarding the Oil Mining Lease under the Petroleum Act is that before it can be granted by the Minister there must have been the discovery of at least 10,000 barrel of crude oil per day worth of exploitation in commercial quantity in the specific area.\n
\nThe Act went further to provide in section 23(1) for the revocation of an Oil Prospecting Licence and an Oil Mining Lease but with the exclusion of the Oil Exploration Licence since exploration is a permanent activity that must be carried out any time there is a need for mining\n

    <string name="basinto">Basic Institution in the Oil Industry</string>
    <string name="basinto1">Sometime in September 1960, five oil producing countries came together to establish what is today known as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as a result of the protest owing to the domination and control of the International Oil Corporations (IOCs).\n
 \nThis organization has fundamentally influenced the growth and direction of the international oil industry. OPEC had its founding members as Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. It is important to mention that the behaviour of the International Oil Corporations (IOCs) worked great hardship to the oil producing host countries. Prior to the establishment of OPEC, the International Oil Corporations (IOCs) dictated how much oil was extracted or produced, how much it was sold, who the oil was sold to, and when it should be sold; all to the disadvantage of the owners of the oil. Not only did the host countries have no say in the industry, they received very little in return for the oil produced. As a matter of fact, no taxes were paid initially. The royalty paid was little, was based on weight and volume rather than on price, and was expensed (deducted or charged to an expense account) by the companies when tax rates started to be applied. The final crunch came in 1959 when the International Oil Corporations (IOCs) unilaterally cut the posted price for Venezuela crude as well as for Middle East. As if that was not enough, in August 1960 further reductions ranging from $0.1 and $0.14 per barrel were made. While these amounts appear quite small, they amounted to sizeable reductions in revenue for the oil producing states. It was in reaction to these price cuts that led to a meeting of oil producing state between 10th and 14th of the following month (that is September 1960) in Baghdad, Iraq. The meeting was attended by representatives of the government of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The outcome of the meeting was the formation of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) with its headquarters in Vienna, Austria. It is pertinent to mention that Article 2 of the OPEC Statute clearly outlined the aims and objectives of the organization. These include\n
\n1. To ensure the stabilization of prices in the international oil market so as to do away with harmful and unnecessary fluctuations in prices\n
 \n2. To have a harmonised and unified petroleum policies and to safeguard the best interest of Member States, individually and collectively.\n
\n3. To ensure steady income for Host Countries (HCs), an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to the consuming benefit of citizens in the Host Countries and a fair return on their capital to those investing in the petroleum industry.\n
\nIn summary therefore, it can be concluded from this Article that the major aims of OPEC were price stabilization and as well as the growth of petroleum industries of member states.\n
\nAt the OPEC conference of Sovereigns and Heads of State in 1966, Member States adopted the ‗Solemn Declaration‘ which is to the effect that OPEC should seek, in cooperation with other countries, for the creation of a New Economic Order based on justice, mutual understanding and genuine concern for the well-being of all people of the world. Among other things, the declaration determined that the interests of OPEC member states required that oil prices should take into account the following:\n
\ni. The imperatives of conservation of petroleum, including its depletion and increasing scarcity in the future\n
\n ii. The value of oil in terms of its non-energy use, and\n
\niii. The conditions of availability, utilisation and cost of alternative sources of energy.\n
\n<b>Membership</b>
\n Membership of OPEC is opened to any country that is an exporter of crude oil having a similar interest with those of the original founders. Article 7c of the OPEC Statute provides that any country which is a substantial net exporter of crude oil and which has fundamentally similar interest to those of the member countries may become a full member if it is accepted by three quarters of the full members of the organization including the founding members.\n
\n Basically, four major criteria determine membership of OPEC;\n
\n 1. Such a country that wishes to join must be a developing country\n
 \n2. Such a country must be a larger exporter of crude oil\n
 \n3. Such a country must be dependent on their oil revenues for the financing of their national budgets\n
\n4. Such a country must be such as needed the assistance of foreign experts in developing their oil industry\n
\n<b>Organs of OPEC</b>\n
 \nThere are three major functional organs of OPEC. These include;\n
\n1. The Conference\n
\n2. The Board of Governors\n
\n 3. The Secretariat\n
\n<b>The Conference</b>
\n The conference is the highest decision making organ of OPEC. It consists of heads of delegations of member states, usually the Minister of Petroleum of the different countries of the member states. The conference as an organ of OPEC meets twice a year. Decisions other than on procedural matters require the unanimous agreement of all members. However the absence of a full member at a meeting does not prevent a Resolution from becoming effective unless the Secretariat receives a notification to the contrary from the said member at least ten days before the date fixed for publication of the Resolutions.\n
\n<b>Functions of the Conference</b>
 \n The conference has the following functions\n
\n 1. The conference is responsible for the formulation of general policy for the organization and to determine the appropriate ways and means of better policy implementation.\n
\n 2. To determine and approve applications for membership of the organization\n
\n 3. To confirm the appointment of members of the board of governors\n
\n 4. To consider the budget of the organization as submitted by the board of governors, statement of account and also considers the auditor‘s report as submitted by the board of governors\n
\n 5. The conference directs the board of governors to submit reports or make recommendations on any matter of interest to the organization\n
\n 6. The conference considers or decides upon the reports and recommendations submitted to the board of governors on the affairs of the organization.\n
\n 7. It is the responsibility of the conference to approve any amendment to the Statute\n
\n 8. The conference appoints chairman of the board of governors and an alternate chairman\n
\n 9. To appoint the secretary general and the deputy secretary general, and\n
\n 10. To appoint the auditor of the organization for a duration of one year.\n
\n<b> The Board of Governors</b>
\nThe board of governors are usually nominated by member countries for a term of two years. The board meets twice in a year. The board of governors is the managing organ of the organization (OPEC)\n
\n<b>Functions of the board of governors</b>
\n 1. The board of governors is responsible for managing the affairs of OPEC as an organization \n
2. It implements the decisions made by the Conference\n
\n3. It decides upon reports submitted to it by the General Secretary\n
\n4. It makes the budget of the organization for each calendar year and submits to the conference for approval\n
\n 5. Submits reports and make recommendations to the Conference on the affairs of the organization,\n
\n6. Nominates the auditor of the organization subject to the approval by the Conference,\n
\n7. It considers the Statement of Accounts and the Auditor‘s report and submit them to the Conference for approval,\n
\n8. Approves the appointment of directors of divisions and heads of department, upon nomination by the member countries; due consideration being given to the recommendations of the secretary-general\n
\n9. Convene an extraordinary meeting of the conference, and\n
\n10. It prepares agenda for the Conference\n
\n<b>The Secretariat</b>
\n This organ is responsible for the executive functions of OPEC as an organization in accordance with the provisions of the Statute and under the directive of the board of governors. The General Secretary as the authorized representative of OPEC and chief officer of the secretariat is usually appointed on merit for a term of three years renewable once for the same period, by the unanimous decision of the Conference. The General Secretary must be a national of one of the member states. Must be up to thirty five years, have a degree from a recognised university in law, science, economics, engineering or business administration, and must have reasonable experience in the oil industry.\n
\n<b>OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID)</b>
\n This is a major institution within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The OPEC fund for International Development is a subsidiary arm of OPEC and was created in 1976 by the member countries of OPEC. The Fund‘s headquarters is also in Vienna, Austria. Its objective was to put funds together to assist OPEC members and other developing oil countries. It however runs as a separate institution from OPEC.\n
\nFunds of the organization are gotten from voluntary contributions by member countries, and accumulated income derived from the Fund‘s investments and loans. All weak and developing countries within the organization of OPEC are eligible for such funds or loans. It is pertinent to mention that priority of assistance is accorded to the least developed country.\n
<b>Contributions/Benefits of OPEC</b>
\n The benefits of OPEC to its member states can be itemized as follows:\n
\n1. OPEC has played important role in promoting policies that helped developed the international oil industry.\n
\n 2. The establishment of OPEC has empowered developing HCs to exercise dominion and control over their own resources.\n
\n3. OPEC has also helped to improve the legal and regulatory framework for the establishment of oil industries of member states. This was essential if meaningful control was to be achieved.\n
\n4. OPEC has also assisted member countries to establish their own nation oil corporations which have enabled member countries to exercise control over their resources and thoroughly participate in the oil industry.\n
\n5. One of OPEC‘s most important contributions was Resolution XVI 90 adopted on June 24 1968 and published on July 24 1968 which stated ten principles, all aimed at improving the legal and regulatory framework for the oil industries of the member countries.\n
\n6. OPEC has also helped member states to draw up new contracts for exploration and development, thus shifting attention from investor-ownership towards ownership and control by the owners of the oil.\n

    <string name="nnpc">The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation</string>
    <string name="nnpc1">After the establishment of OPEC in 1960, its member countries were obligated to establish their national oil corporations to protect their interest and enable them participate in the affairs of their own oil industry.\n
\nThe national oil corporations were established to ensure security of supply. That is, having regular access to its oil so that energy supply in their countries would not be a challenge. It was also established to make profit by improving the financial economy of their respective countries.\n
\nThe Nigerian National Oil Corporation (NNOC) was established in 1971 to primarily engage the prospecting for, mining and marketing of oil and other activities connected with petroleum industry. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation was fully established in April 1977 by the merger of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and the Nigerian National Oil Corporation with its commercial functions and the Federal Ministry of Mines with its regulatory functions.\n
\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) was established as a public organization that would on behalf of government adequately manage all government interest in the Nigeria oil industry. The corporation was given power to explore, refine, transport oil products as well as the marketing of crude oil.\n
\n Between 1978 and 1989 the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation engaged in the construction of refineries in Warri, Kaduna and Port Harcourt. By Decree 33 of the 1977, the functions of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation were stipulated as follows:\n
\n1. To participate in all stages of oil operation – upstream and downstream.\n
\n2. By section 4 of the NNPC Act, it has the power of prospecting, mining, acquiring, possessing and disposing of petroleum products\n
\n3. Section 5 of the NNPC Act establishes its corporate personality such that it can sue and be sued\n
\n4. It has the duty to train Nigerians and technical staff\n
 \n5. It has the duty to refine, treat, process, manufacture and produce petroleum products\n
\n6. It has the duty to purchase and market petroleum products\n
\n7. To provide facilities for the carrying of crude oil and natural gas\n
\n8. The duty of construction of facilities for the treatment of petroleum products\n
\n9. The duty of carrying out research in all areas connecting with petroleum industry\n
\n10. Generally carrying out actions that will enhance the petroleum industry for the overall interest of Nigeria as a country\n
\nThe structure of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation\n
\nSubsidiaries of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation\n
\n As at today, NNPC has about twelve subsidiaries and arms performing various functions. Sometime in 1988 the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation was commercialised into twelve strategic business units covering the entire areas of oil industry operation including exploration and production, gas development, refining, distribution, petrochemical engineering and commercial investment. The subsidiaries include the following:\n
\n1. National Petroleum Investment Management Service: this unit is primarily set up to manage the profit accruing to the federation from its investment from the oil industryn\n
\n2. The Nigerian Petroleum Development Company: this arm was established to profitably operate petroleum exploration and production business both nationally and internationally.\n
\n3. The Nigerian Gas Company Ltd. (NGC): the NGC is charged with the responsibility of developing an affective gas industry to satisfy Nigeria energy needs and to export gas and all its derivatives abroad.\n
\n4. National Engineering and Technical Company Ltd: this subsidiary was established to provide effective and reliably services for NNPC group and the entire oil and gas industry.\n
\n5. Pipeline and Product Marketing Company Ltd. (PPMC): this unit was established to ensure security of supply of petroleum product to the domestic market at low operating cost and also marketing special product competitively in the domestic and international market.\n
\n6. The Integrated Data Service Ltd. (IDSL): this subsidiary was established to provide hydrocarbon exploration services in the local and international oil and gas industry. It engages in data storage and management of data facilities. It has its headquarters in Benin City.\n
\n7. The Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd. (NLNG):\n
 \n8. Hydrocarbon Service Nigeria Ltd.\n
\n9. Warri Refinery and Petrochemical Company Ltd.\n
\n10. Kaduna Refinery and Petrochemical Company Ltd.\n
\n11. Port Harcourt Refinery and Petrochemical Company Ltd.\n
\n12. Eleme Petrochemical Company Ltd.\n
\n<b>Achievements of the NNPC</b>
\n 1. It is important to note that the state owned NNPC provides fuel to industrial facilities, communities, enterprises and individuals with operations covering the entire sector of Nigerian petroleum industry, touching production, distribution, marketing, training workers, managing oil leases or licenses, etc.\n
\n 2. Currently, NNPC is a major revenue earner for the Federal Government, providing jobs for reasonable number of Nigerians.\n
\n3. NNPC spearheaded oil exploration to confirm Nigeria‘s position as the top crude exporter in Africa thereby boosting Nigeria oil revenue.\n
\n4. In 2004, the NNPC launched the West African Pipeline supplying natural gas to several neighbouring countries.\n
\n 5. Nigeria emerged as an important exporter of natural gas with the establishment of the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas plant in Bonny in 2005. This is the effort of NNPC\n
\n6. NNPC has also enhanced access to capital and technology and promoting independent control of joint venture investment.\n
\n<b>Challenges of NNPC</b>
\n 1. Government unnecessary interference in the affairs of the organization has thus far made the establishment less competitive when compared with other private oil companies. Therefore private interest in NNPC overrides the public or general interest of the corporation thereby undermining the whole essence or goal of the corporation.\n
\n 2. Politics of selection of its managenrial team\n
\n3. Corruption is also a major challenge\n
\n4. Lack of accountability.\n

    <string name="thecjv">The Contractual Joint Venture</string>
    <string name="thecjv1">Contractual joint venture was a new form of contractual arrangement by which oil right could be acquired by the International Oil Corporations. It firmly affirms the Host Country‘s status as the undisputable owners of the natural resources being developed by the International Oil Corporations.\n
\nContract for exploration and production exist in every country where oil exploration and production takes place. It is important to mention that before the establishment of a contractual joint venture the international oil companies and the host countries normally would agree as to the legal framework to be adopted in the running of the contract. The following are some of the framework:\n
\n1. The Fixed Contract System\n
\n2. The Agreement System\n
\n<b>The Fixed Contract System</b>
\n By this legal framework, the legislature fixes in advance the condition under which the right to explore for oil resources may be granted. This system of contract has a great advantage for the Host Countries in that the term fixed by legislation can be unilaterally varied by subsequent legislation.\n
\nThis system has the advantage of giving the assurance of equal treatment to the international oil companies. As a matter of fact, the IOCs prefer this type of agreement. It also gives the Host Countries a stronger hand in terms of negotiations in that the laws that regulate the contract are basically those made by the Host Countries.\n
\nHowever, the fixed contract system has that following disadvantages, in that:\n
\n1. The rigidity involved has difficulty in attracting the international oil companies\n
\n2. The standard often set by the legislations are often too high or too low and may also defeat the Host Country‘s objectives which is basically to exercise control and more revenue\n
\n<b>The Agreement System</b>
\n Under this system the legislation is of a general nature. The contract under this system is based on individually negotiated agreement. This system provides maximum flexibility to both the international oil companies and the Host Countries. It is basically limited to the agreement of the parties. This system gives a lot of room to the power of negotiations.\n
\n<b>Flexible/Hybrid System</b>
\n By this framework the legislation lays down general guidelines and conditions that are applicable to the international oil companies while certain important terms are settled by negotiations. Thus this system is a combination of the fixed system and the agreement system. It is the most common type of legal framework for a contractual joint venture, and the Nigerian Petroleum Act of 1969 falls under this system.\n
\n<b> Types of Contractual Joint Venture</b>
\n Two major types of contractual joint venture would be examined under this heading, these are:\n
\n1. The Production Sharing Contract, and\n
 \n2. The Service Contract\n
\n<b>The Production Sharing Contract</b>
\nProduction Sharing Contract is a legal arrangement in which the oil produced is shared by the parties in a predetermined proportion. The following are the features of typical Production Sharing Contract:\n
\n1. The international oil company is an appointed contractor\n
\n2. The international oil company bears the risk and expenses\n
\n3. The host county is the owner of the natural resources\n
\n4. All transactions and payments are made in crude oil\n
\n5. In the contract there is the recognition of operational cost or cost oil (a portion of oil set aside to defray the expenses incurred)\n
\n6. There is also the recognition of tax oil (the proportion of oil set aside for the payment of tax)\n
\n7. There is the recognition of profit oil\n
\n8. Installations and equipment under the contract becomes that of the host countries since the host countries have technically paid for them via the cost oil\n
\n<b>The Service Contract </b>
\nThis type of contractual joint venture came into existence in the late 1960 and originated in Brazil. The service contract is different from the production sharing contract majorly because the payment of recovery cost and the remuneration of the international oil company is in cash and not in crude oil, and where oil is not found in commercial quantity the international oil company as a contractor gets nothing under the service contract.\n
\n<b>Features of the Service Contract</b>
\n 1. The Host Country is the sole owner of the crude oil\n
\n 2. The international oil company is mainly a contractor\n
\n3. The international oil company bears all the risks on the investment\n
\n4. The contract involves payment of fees for services rendered\n
\n5. The Host Country takes over operation at the point of production\n
\n6. Reimbursement of the international oil company‘s finance is carried out over a number of years when the money involved is huge\n
\n7. The international oil company can buy and export a portion of the oil at the world market price\n
\n<b>Nigerian Example of a Service Contract</b>
\n 1. Provision of Funds: the international oil companies provide the funds for exploration, development, expertise and all other funds that are needed for production. Where oil is not discovered in commercial volume no reimbursement is made and the contract terminates therefrom.\n
\n2. Reimbursement and Remuneration: once oil is found in commercial quantity finance is reimbursed and services are remunerated and the international oil company however is given the first option to buy oil as produced\n
\n 3. Payment of Taxes: it is important to note that the international oil company pays tax under the Company Income Tax Account of 1979 while NNPC pays tax under the Petroleum Profit Tax Account of 1959\n
\n 4. Training of Nigerians: Nigerians are to be engaged to the maximum except for specialised and technical job. Within six months of effective date the international oil company is expected to submit to NNPC a programme for the training of Nigerians\n
\n5. Exploration Programme and Budget: the international oil companies are expected to submit for approval to NNPC programmes and budget for exploration within the first three month of each year. Then the NNPC and the international oil company would meet on the budget examination. When amendment is needed both would need to come to a compromise for such amendment. Please note that the service contract clearly affirms the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources and work more in favour of the Host Countries.\n
\n<b>Pure Service Contract</b>
\n This constitutes a minor contract of work. Under this system all the risks of exploration and production come to the Host Country as opposed to the practice under the Service Contract where the IOC bears the risk of exploration. The contractor under this style of contract carries out specialised and mapped out services and receives payment only for such services.\n
\n<b>Technical Assistance Contract</b>\n
\n Here the Host Country engages the services of the contracting company just to offer technical service without any form of interest in oil. Transfer of technology and knowledge are likely to be perfected under this system. It must be note that the Host Country own the oil, the equipment and is in charge of the entire operation through its own national oil company.\n
\n<b>Stabilization Clauses</b>
\nStabilisation has been defined as ―the contract language which freezes the provisions of a national system of law chosen as the law of the contract as to the date of the contract in order to prevent the application to the contract of any future alterations of this system‖\n
\nThe stabilization clauses which are included in the current international petroleum, gas and mineral agreements have become a common feature. They protect the interests of both contracting parties to the agreement concerned against any unilateral termination or modification by either party without mutual consent of the other party obtained in advance. They safeguard the interest of the foreign investor intending to invest in a country which has different socio-economic conditions prevailing and different legal systems in practice. Out of many concerns, which the investor has in his mind, political instability and poor governance of the host state tops the list. To avoid worst fears come true, investors generally demand legal guarantees from the government of the host country in which they intend to invest huge amount of capital and technical know-how. The banks and financial institutions which finance the project fear the same risk as much as an investor does and would like to see the stability in the contractual regime. Therefore a contractual obligation in the form of stabilization clause is believed to be the panacea for all such feared risks. Thus the inclusion of the stabilization clauses creates a standard pattern and thereby avoiding the whims \n
\nThe intended effect of this clause, sometimes known also as the intangibility clause, is such that the law applicable to the agreement will always be ‗…the law of the host State in force at the time of the conclusion of the contract, thus excluding the applicability of any future laws and regulations‘. Thereby essentially ‗freezing the law‘ and ensuring that favourable conditions which encouraged the multinational to invest in the State‘s reserves are preserved in perpetuity. By stabilization clause the State accepts that the exercise of its legislative and administrative powers will not have the effect of modifying the contractual conditions agreed with the investor to the latter‘s detriment\n
\nThe purpose of stabilization clauses is essentially to protect the investment and interest of international oil corporations from the spectre of unilateral change of the law of the host countries\n
\nStabilization clauses have to do with sanctity of contract. It simply talks about contractual stability. The issue of contractual stability represents a major source of conflict between international oil companies and host countries. It is important to note that while the international oil companies desire and prefer stability and predictability of contract wherein all possibilities can be predetermined, the Host Countries on the other hand prefer flexibility of contractual relationship. In a joint venture relationship the international oil company presses for the principle of pacta sunt servanda – that is, sanctity of contract, whereby it is impossible for one party to modify or terminate an existing contract. The legal consequence of this reasoning is that the host country is not entitled unilaterally to modify or terminate the contract with the international oil company. The practical effect is that the contract cannot be renegotiated or reviewed.\n
\nStabilization clauses usually take the following forms:\n
\n 1. It can be out rightly stated in the agreement that subsequent legislations will not affect the international oil company‘s rights.\n
\n 2. It can be inserted through the anti-inconsistency rule, that is, where there is any inconsistency between the oil agreement and the law of the land, the oil agreement prevails.\n
\n 3. It can also appear by freezing clauses. Under the freezing clauses the applicable law to the contract is fixed or frozen from the day the contract is made and applies throughout the life span of the contract.\n
\n<b>Do Stabilisation clauses achieve their Goals?</b>
\n It is beyond reasonable doubt that the oil and gas contracts are influenced by many dynamic factors such as market conditions and the political stability of the country and the state of the economic governance in a particular country. Even a country which is highly noted for its stability in governance and control over policies as Norway has changed the taxrate, two-fold of the agreed rate, soon after the discovery was made at the North Sea. Regardless of the stabilization clause, the approach works true in many situations like this. In reality the stabilization clauses cannot stand the pressure of the dynamic market conditions and the high volatility of the oil prices\n
\nIt is established principle in many jurisdictions that the executive powers of the state cannot be fettered by the contract with a private individual or corporations. The position is same in England and Wales and in some Middle Eastern countries. It is held that a state‘s authority over its natural resources cannot be contracted out. Thus in <i>British Petroleum v. Government of Libya (1974) 53 ILR 297</i>, the arbitrator held that despite the stabilization clauses, the nationalization was effective. In other words, the stabilization clauses were legally ineffective to nullify the nationalization measures.\n
\nThe stabilisations clauses become unenforceable sometimes as they are often imposed by the constraints of legal and constitutional framework of the host country. The oil company will therefore be left with no protection against the hostility of the state. Therefore in practicality the stabilisation clauses as they are called are not able to render their protection to the investor.\n
\nThe effectiveness of these clauses may be doubted whenever they purport to limit the States‘ inalienable prerogatives, as it would be the case of a stabilization clause providing for the prohibition of nationalization or expropriation. It is a principle of public international law that States may not renounce sovereign prerogatives, the exercise of which is instrumental to the pursuance of the country‘s essential public objectives. A stabilization clause contradicting mandatory rules of international law (jus cogens) may not therefore produce its typical effects. The principle of permanent sovereignty of each State over its natural resources assumes in this context a significant relevance. The qualification of the State‘s sovereignty as permanent has led States to consider that the right to exploit the natural resources is inalienable so that it cannot be hindered or restricted by commitments conventionally undertaken vis-à-vis other States or private parties.\n
\n<b>The Renegotiation Clause</b>
\n Renegotiation clauses are provisions in contracts that, upon the happening of certain event or events, require all parties to return to the bargaining table and renegotiate the terms of their agreements\n
\nThe use of renegotiation clause has gained tremendous importance especially in the petroleum development agreements as it has become a suitable alternative to the classical stabilisation clauses in this respect. The negotiation clause allows the parties to accommodate the fundamental changes to the already existing agreement\n
\nA renegotiation clause usually operates in the presence of change of circumstances that are beyond the control of the parties which causes a substantial modification of the economic equilibrium of the contract. In the event of the failure of the Stabilisation clause which intends to freeze the parties‘ rights and obligations on the principle of pacta sunt servanda, a renegotiation clause brings the parties back to the round table in the event of change of circumstance under the legal rule of rebus sic stantibus, i.e. as long as circumstances remain the same.\n
\nRenegotiation clause leads to a justifiable change in a joint venture agreement. Note that renegotiation comes into play when there is a triggering event that calls for it, such as fluctuations in world oil prices, a peculiar problem of long term agreement, war, fraud, natural disaster etc\n
\n<b>Functions of the Renegotiation clauses</b>
\n 1. The renegotiation clauses strike a balance between the investor and the host government.\n
\n2. The clause tries to preserve the interests of both the parties by leaving the state‘s sovereignty intact and at the same time protects the investor against changes in law governing the agreement.\n
\n3. The renegotiation clause in an agreement allows modifying the agreement which is previously concluded between the parties rather than the termination of contract by either party when a dispute arises\n
\n4. The purpose of the negotiation clauses is often achieved if the scope is limited to unforeseen conditions not within the control of either of the parties.\n
\n 5. Where there is no renegotiation clause in the agreements, it may be difficult to bring the less vulnerable party back to the negotiation table. This offers as a dispute resolute mechanism between the parties and an occasion to resolve the unfilled gaps in the contractual agreement.\n
\n<b>Advantages of the renegotiation clause</b>
\n 1. One major advantage of the renegotiation clause is that it gives room for flexibility in oil investment contract. Note that Nigeria in its oil deals recognises the use of renegotiation clause.\n
\n2. By this practice, it helps the Host Countries and the international oil companies to recognise triggering events and also helps to prevent conflicts between the parties over the contract\n
\n3. Renegotiation clause is more desirable, realistic and more enforceable irrespective of its pitfalls, because it secures the protection of both parties‘ interest against the hardship caused to either of them by the inevitable change of circumstance which was not present at the conclusion of the Production Sharing Agreement.\n
\n4. It is thus a new purposive approach which when followed diligently and enforced honestly by the host state, will enable it to renegotiate in good faith and consequently bind itself to further negotiate with the IOC, rather than unilaterally altering the terms of the agreement.\n
\n5. It is also a suitable alternative to a stabilisation clause as there will be no fear of threat to the effectiveness of the host state‘s flexibility of laws and sovereign rights over her natural resources\n
 \n6. Renegotiation clauses offer the parties an opportunity to complete an incomplete contract by filling in the gaps and enabling them to allocate un-envisaged risks while sharing unanticipated profit.\n
\nRenegotiation clauses are not a panacea; they have a number of draw backs. Investors may refuse to indicate them in their contracts for five reasons. First, such clauses may reduce contract stability. Second, including renegotiation clauses may raise the overall costs of the transaction. Third, if the parties are unable to agree as a result of renegotiation and third party adaptation of the contract is sought an arbitral tribunal may decline to exercise its jurisdiction or the adaptation may be unenforceable because of lack of a dispute between the parties. Fourth, if the parties‘ original agreement fails to provide the tribunal with sufficient parameters to adapt the contract, the tribunal may re write the agreement in a way that neither party intended. Fifth, if the events which trigger the renegotiation may be within the control of the host state, raising the possibility that the process could be used unfairly to alter the agreement."

    <string name="police1">
Among the many agencies of government administering criminal justice is the Nigeria Police Force. <i>Section 214(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999</i> as amended (hereinafter referred to the 1999 Constitution) provides for the establishment of the Nigeria Police Force. The section provides that there shall be a police force for Nigeria, which shall be known as the Nigeria Police Force, and subject to the provisions of this section no other police force shall be established for the Federation or any part thereof. <i>Section 3 of the Police Act, Cap 319 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004</i> (hereinafter referred to as the Police Act) provides thus ―There shall be established for Nigeria a police force to be known as the Nigeria Police Force (hereafter in this Act referred to as ―the Force‖).\n
\nBy <i>section 214(2) (a) of the 1999 Constitution</i>, it is provided that the Nigeria Police Force shall be organized and administered in accordance with such provisions as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly.\n
\n<i>Section 214(2) (b) of the 1999 Constitution</i> provides that the members of the Nigeria Police shall have such powers and duties as may be conferred upon them by law.\n
\n<i> Section 215 of the 1999 Constitution</i> sets out the general structure of the Nigeria Police Force with the Inspector General of Police at the apex of the structure. Section 215(1) of the 1999 Constitution provides that the Inspector-General of Police shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Nigeria Police Council from among serving members of the Nigeria Police Force.\n
\nOther statutes providing for police powers and duties in addition to the Constitution and the Police Act include:\n
 \n1. The Criminal Procedure Act, Cap. C41, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria\n
 \n2. Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015\n
\n3. The Criminal Procedure Code, C3, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria\n
\n4. Penal Code, P3 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria\n
\n5. Sherriff and Council Process Act\n
\n<b>The Role of the Police in Criminal Justice Administration</b>
\n The role of the police in criminal justice in Nigeria may be subsumed under the following;\n
\n1. Arrest\n
\n 2. Investigation of crime and interrogation of criminal suspect\n
\n 3. Prosecution of accused person\n
\n 4. Bail\n
\n5. Searches of person, things, property, etc.\n
\n<b>ARREST </b>
\nArrest maybe defined as the apprehension, stoppage, seizure, or to hinder the motion or action of a person or thing. It is the taking and restraining of a person from his or her liberty in order that he or she shall be forthcoming to answer to an alleged or suspected crime or offence.\n
\nThe police is empowered by virtue of <i>section 4 of the Police Act</i> to arrest offenders.\n
\n<b>Mode of Arrest</b>
\n Under <i>section 4 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015</i> (hereinafter referred to as ACJA 2015), in making an arrest, the police officer or other persons making the same shall actually touch or confine the body of the person to be arrested, unless there is a submission to custody by words or action. See section 3 CPA. Therefore a refusal to submit can amount to the offence of resisting arrest or obstruction of a police officer in the execution of his duty. This is on the authority of <i>Ateze v. Momoh (1985) NRNLR 127.</i>\n
\nBy the provisions of <i>section 5(a) – (c) ACJA 2015</i>, a suspect or defendant may not be handcuffed, bound or be subjected to restraint except:\n
\na. there is reasonable apprehension of violence or an attempt to escape;\n
\nb. the restraint is considered necessary for the safety of the suspect or defendant; or\n
\nc. by order of a court. See <i>section 4 CPA, section 31 CPC or section 37 CPC.</i>\n
\n<i>Section 6(1) ACJA 2015</i> provides thus: ―Except when the suspect is in the actual course of the commission of an offence or is pursued immediately after the commission of an offence or has escaped from lawful custody, the police officer or other persons making the arrest shall inform the suspect immediately of the reason for the arrest.‖ <i>See section 5 of the CPA. Abu Ankwa v. The State (1969) 1 All NLR133</i>\n
\nIt is also the law that a suspects must be allow to access their counsel at the point of arraignment. <i>Ikonne v. COP (1987) 2 NLCC 1130 at 1145</i>\n
\nThe police officer making the arrest shall inform the suspect of his right to remain silent or avoid answering any question until consultation with a legal practitioner or any other person of his own choice.\n
\nThis right is also provided for by virtue of <i>section 6(2) (a) – (c) ACJA 2015</i>. That section provides that the police officer or the person making the arrest or the police officer in charge of a police station shall inform the suspect of his rights to:\n
 \na. remain silent or avoid answering any question until after consultation with a legal practitioner or any other person of his own choice;\n
\n b. consult a legal practitioner of his choice before making, endorsing or writing any statement or answering any question put to him after arrest; and\n
\nc. free legal representation by the Legal Aid Council of Nigeria where applicable\n
\nIt is illegal to arrest a person in the place of another. By virtue of <i>section 7 ACJA 2015</i>, a person shall not be arrested in lieu of a suspect.\n
\nUnder <i>section 8(1) (a) and (b) ACJA 2015</i>, a suspect shall:\n
\n a. be accorded humane treatment, having regard to his right to the dignity of his person; and\n
\nb. not be subjected to any form of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\n
\nBy the provisions of <i>section 8(2) ACJA 2015</i>, a suspect shall not be arrested merely on a civil wrong or breach of contract.\n
\nBy the provisions of <i>section 9(1) (a) and (b) ACJA 2015</i>, where a suspect is arrested by a police officer or a private person, the officer making the arrest or to whom the private person hands over the suspect:\n
\n a. may search the suspect, using such force as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose; and\n
\nb. shall place in safe custody all articles other than necessary wearing apparel found on the suspect.\n
\nFurther, according to <i>section 9(4) ACJA 2015</i>, notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a police officer or any other person making an arrest may in any case take from the suspect any instrument of violence or poisonous substance which he has on his person.\n
\n<i>Section 10(1) – (7) ACJA 2015</i> provides thus:\n
\n (1) A police officer making an arrest or to whom a private person hands over the suspect, shall immediately record information about the arrested suspect and an inventory of all items or property recovered from the suspect.\n
\n (2) An inventory recorded under subsection (1) of this section shall be duly signed by the police officer and the arrested suspect, but the failure of the arrested suspect to sign the inventory shall not invalidate it.\n
\n(3) The arrested suspect, his legal practitioner or such other person, as the arrested suspect may direct, shall be given a copy of the inventory.\n
\n(4) Where any property has been taken under this section from an arrested suspect, a police officer may, upon request by either the owner of the property or parties having interest in the property, release such property on bond pending the arraignment of the arrested suspect before a court.\n
\n(5) Where a police officer refuses to release the property to the owner or any person having interest in the property under subsection (4) of this section, the police officer shall make a report to the court of the fact of the property taken from the arrested suspect and the particulars of the property.\n
\n(6) The court to which a report is made under subsection (5) of this section, may, if it is of the opinion that the property or any portion of it can be returned in the interest of justice to the safe custody of the owner or person having interest in the property, direct that the property or any portion of it be returned to the owner or to such person having interest in the property.\n
\n (7) Where any property has been taken from a suspect under this section, and the suspect is not charged before a court but is released on the ground that there is no sufficient reason to believe that he has committed an offence, any property so taken from the suspect shall be returned to him, provided the property is neither connected to nor a proceed of offence.\n
\nBy <i>section 15(1) (a) – (d) ACJA 2015</i>, it is provided that where a suspect is arrested, whether with or without a warrant, and taken to a police station or any other agency effecting the arrest, the police officer making the arrest or the officer in charge shall cause to be taken immediately, in the prescribed form, the following record of the suspect arrested:\n
\n(a) the alleged offence;\n
\n(b) the date and circumstances of his arrest;\n
\n(c) his full name, occupation and residential address; and\n
(d) for the purpose of identification:\n
\n(i) his height,\n
\n(ii) his photograph,\n
\n(iii) his full fingerprint impressions, or\n
\n(iv) such other means of his identification\n
\n Finally, by <i>section 15(4) ACJA 2015</i>, where a suspect who is arrested with or without a warrant volunteers to make a confessional statement, the police officer shall ensure that the making and taking of the statement shall be in writing and may be recorded electronically on a retrievable video compact disc or such other audio visual means\n
\n<b>Investigation of Crime and Interrogation of Criminal Suspect</b>
\n Another important duties and responsibility of the police in the administration of criminal justice in Nigeria are in the area of criminal investigation of criminal suspects. The investigative duty of the police, though not expressly stated in the Police Act, can be inferred from the provisions of <i>section 4 of the Police Act</i>.\n
\nIn criminal justice process, evidence must be adduced in order to successfully prosecute or discharge an accused person. Unfortunately, police in Nigeria sometimes use unorthodox method to extract information or evidence from suspect. They sometimes use torture or intimidation to extract information.\n
\nIn <i>Ibrahim v. R (1914) A.C. 599</i>, the court held that the positive rule of English criminal law is that no statement by accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shown by prosecution to have been voluntary statement in the sense that it had not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by person in authority.\n
\n<b>JUDGES RULE</b>\n
\n The judges Rule has to do with the mechanism of caution. These rules were laid down in 1912 by the Judges of the King‘s Bench to guide the Police and other members of the Executive who may be engaged in criminal investigation. The rules were designed to forestall the use of third hand method or extra legal means of obtaining statements or extracting evidence from suspects. The Rules are not rules of law, but rather rules of practice for the guidance of the police, setting out the kinds of conduct that could cause a judge to exercise discretion to exclude evidence, in the interests of a fair trial.\n
\nThe purpose of this rule is that whatever statement a suspect makes during police inquiry must be voluntary. This includes oral or written statement. Under the Judges rules, a police officer, in endeavoring to discover whether or by whom an offence has been committed, is entitled to question any person(s) whether suspected or not from whom he thinks that useful information may be obtained. It also includes the requirement of posing for photograph. All these must be voluntary. <i>R v. Ugama (1959) 4 FSC 218</i>\n
\n<b>The requirements of Judges Rule</b>
\n 1. This requirement obliges a police officer to warn a suspect before he volunteers a statement in respect of the offence for which he is suspected.\n
\n2. The mechanism of caution confers the prerogative on a suspect to remain silent and not to say anything to confirm or deny his complicity in the criminal charge(s) or allegation against him. The police officer formally cautions the suspect thus “you are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but whatever you say may be put into writing and given in evidence.” The phrase ―and may be used in evidence AGAINST you‖ is not to be used. A voluntarily statement may be given in evidence: it is NOT given in evidence AGAINST anybody. The device of caution is to assure voluntariness of statement, be it oral or written\n
\n<b>BAIL</b>
\nBail is a procedure by which a person arrested, detained, and/or prosecuted in connection with a crime may be released on security as may be determined by the person or the authority effecting the release. It is predicated on the assumption of innocence until the contrary is proved.\n
\n<i>Section 27 of the Police Act</i> provides that when a person is arrested without a warrant, he shall be taken before a magistrate who has jurisdiction with respect to the offence with which he is charged or is empowered to deal with him under section 484 of the Criminal Procedure Act as soon as practicable after he is taken into custody: Provided that any police officer for the time being in charge of a police station may inquire into the case and-\n
\n(a) except when the case appears to such officer to be of a serious nature, may release such person upon his entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties, for a reasonable amount to appear before a magistrate at the day, time and place mentioned in the recognisance; or\n
\n(b) if it appears to such officer that such inquiry cannot be completed forthwith, may release such person on his entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties for a reasonable amount, to appear at such police station and at such times as are named in the recognisance, unless he previously receives notice in writing from the superior police officer in charge of that police station that his attendance is not required, and any such bond may be enforced as if it were a recognizance conditional for the appearance of the said person before a magistrate.\n
\n<i>Under section 30(1) ACJA 2015</i>, where a suspect has been taken into police custody without a warrant for an offence other than an offence punishable with death, an officer in charge of a police station shall inquire into the case and release the suspect arrested on bail subject to subsection (2) of this section.\n
\nBy virtue of <i>section 31(1) ACJA 2015</i>, where a suspect is taken into custody, and it appears to the officer that the inquiry into the case cannot be completed forthwith, he may discharge the suspect on his entering into a recognizance, with or without sureties for a reasonable amount, to appear at the police station and at such times as are named in the recognizance, unless he previously receives notice in writing from the police officer in charge of that police station that his attendance is not required\n
\n Bail is important because of the constitutional right of every person to his personal liberty. Section 35(1) (c) CFRN 1999 provides that every person shall be entitled to his personal liberty and no person shall be deprived of such liberty save for the purpose of bringing him before a court in execution of the order of a court or upon reasonable suspicion of his having committed a criminal offence, or to such extent as may be reasonably necessary to prevent his committing a criminal offence and this must be in accordance with a procedure permitted by law.\n
\nSection 32(1) – (3) ACJA 2015 provides thus:\n
\n(1) Where a suspect taken into custody in respect of a non-capital offence is not released on bail after 24 hours, a court having jurisdiction with respect to the offence may be notified by application on behalf of the suspect.\n
\n (2) The court shall order the production of the suspect detained and inquire into the circumstances constituting the grounds of the detention and where it deems fit, admit the suspect detained to bail\n
\n(3) An application for bail under this section may be made orally or in writing\n
\n The police or an officer in charge of a police station or an official in charge of an agency authorised to make arrest has the duty to report to the nearest Magistrate on the last working day of every month, the cases of all suspects arrested without warrant within the limits of their respective stations.\n
\nBy the provisions of <i>section 33(1) – (6) ACJA 2015</i>:\n
\n(1) An officer in charge of a police station or an official in charge of an agency authorised to make arrest shall, on the last working day of every month, report to the nearest Magistrate the cases of all suspects arrested without warrant within the limits of their respective stations or agency whether the suspects have been admitted to bail or not.\n
\n(2) The report shall contain the particulars of the suspects arrested as prescribed in section 15 of this Act.\n
\n (3) The Magistrate shall on receipt of the reports, forward them to the Criminal Justice Monitoring Committee which shall analyse the reports and advice the Attorney-General of the Federation as to the trends of arrests, bail and related matters.\n
\n (4) The Attorney-General of the Federation shall, upon request by the National Human Rights Commission, the Legal Aid Council of Nigeria or a Non-Governmental Organization, make the report available to them.\n
\n(5) Where no report is made in accordance with subsection (1) of this section, the Magistrate shall forward a report to the Chief Judge of the State and the Attorney-General of the State for appropriate remedial action.\n
\n(6) With respect to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja such report referred to in subsection (5) of this section shall be forwarded to the Chief Judge of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja and the Attorney-General of the Federation for remedial action. However, the police have been known to violate not only these constitutional or statutory provisions but have shamelessly asked for gratification and sometimes incarcerate vulnerable suspects with impunity. See <i>Olugbesi v. COP (1970) All NLR…</i>

    <string name="prosecute">Criminal Prosecution</string>
    <string name="prosecute1">Apart from the general duties of the police as contained in section 4 of the Police Act, the police is also empowered to prosecute by virtue of <i>section 23 of the Act</i>. This section provides as follows: ―subject to the provisions of <i>sections 174 and 211 of the 1999 CFRN</i> (which relates to the power of the Attorney General to institute and undertake, take over and continue or discontinue criminal proceedings against any person before any court of law in Nigeria), any police officer may conduct in person all criminal prosecution before any court whether or not the information or complaint is laid in his name.\n
\nThe issue of whether or not police officers can conduct criminal prosecution in any court in Nigeria has been a subject of contention over the years. <i>Olusemou &amp; Ors v. C.O.P. [1998] 11 NWLR (Pt. 757) 547</i>\n
\nGenerally, the police prosecute bulk of the criminal cases in courts of summary jurisdictions, i.e. magistrate courts. Flowing from the provisions of <i>section 24 of the Police Act</i>, the police can also sign an information and prosecute cases in the High Court. The only limitation is that such proceedings can be taken over or discontinued by the Attorney General of the Federation or State who has the overriding power in this respect. This proposition was given judicial notification in <i>Olusemou v. COP supra</i>, where the court held that a police officer whether legally qualified or not can prosecute criminals in any court in Nigeria in as much as the Attorney General did not wheel his statutory power of Nolle prosequi.\n
\nHowever, where the power of the police to prosecute is directly or indirectly removed by a statute or any other law in respect of any particular offence or in a particular proceeding before a particular court, then the competence of the police to prosecute can effectively be challenged. In <i>Osahon &amp; Ors v. FRN [2003] 16 NWLR (Pt. 854) 89</i>, it was held by the Court of Appeal that the provisions of section 56(1) of the Federal High Court Act have effectively robbed the police of the power to prosecute at the Federal High Court\n
\nBy virtue of the decisions of the court in these cases, the Supreme Court had established that there is nothing precluding police officers from appearing and prosecuting matters in the Supreme Court. This is however subject to one limitation; that any such police officer detailed to prosecute a matter at the Superior Courts must have been called to the Nigerian Bar. Although, this limitation is not stated in the Supreme Court judgment, it accords with common sense and the practice and procedure of the superior court.\n
\n<b>Warrant of Arrest</b>
\n A warrant of arrest is an authority in writing by court to a police officer or any other person to arrest an offender in certain defined circumstances.<i>Sections 58 CPC</i>, provides that a warrant of arrest shall ordinarily be directed to one or more police officers or other public servants who may be authorised to make an arrest, but the court or justice of the peace issuing the warrant may, if its immediate execution is necessary and no police officer or other public servant so authorized is immediately available, direct it to any other person or persons. When a warrant is directed to more persons than one, it may be executed by all or by any one or more of them. See <i>section 25 CPA,</i>\n
\n<i>Section 35 ACJA 2015</i> deals with the general authority to issue warrant. That section provides that where under a law, there is power to arrest a suspect with warrant, a warrant for his arrest may be issued\n
\nA warrant of arrest is applied for where the allegation against the offender is serious or where a summon is disobeyed. According to <i>section 36(2) ACJA 2015</i>, a warrant shall state concisely the offence or matter for which it is issued and shall name or otherwise describe the suspect to be arrested, and it shall order the police officer or officers to whom it is directed to arrest the suspect and bring him before the court to answer the complaint or statement, or to testify or be dealt with according to the circumstances of the case.\n
\nA warrant of arrest may be issued on any day, including a Sunday or public holiday. This is on the authority of section 38 ACJA 2015. Further, by <i>section 39(2) ACJA</i> a warrant remains in force until it is executed or cancelled by a Judge or a Magistrate. This is also provided for under <i>section 56(2) CPC</i>, to the effect that every such warrant shall remain in force until it is cancelled by the court or justice of the peace issuing it or until it is executed.\n
\nA warrant of arrest can be executed on any day, including on Sunday and on public holiday. This is on the authority of <i>section 43(1) ACJA 2015</i>. See also <i>section 24 CPA</i>. By virtue of <i>section 43(2) ACJA 2015</i>, a warrant of arrest may be executed by any police officer at any time and in any place in any State other than within the actual court room in which a court is sitting.\n
\n By the provision of <i>section 44 ACJA 2015</i>, a warrant of arrest may be executed notwithstanding that it is not in the possession of the person executing the warrant. However, the warrant shall, on the demand by the suspect, be shown to him as soon as practicable after his arrest\n
\n The power of the police to arrest without having warrant in possession is also encapsulated under <i>section 25 Police Act</i>. The section is to the effect that any warrant lawfully issued by a court for apprehending any person charged with any offence may be executed by any police officer at any time notwithstanding that the warrant is not in his possession at that time, but the warrant shall, on the demand of the person apprehended, be shown to him as soon as practicable after his arrest.\n
\n<i> Search of place entered by suspect sought to be arrested</i>\n
\n Section 12(1) ACJA 2015 provides that where a person or police officer acting under a warrant of arrest or otherwise having authority to arrest, has reason to believe that the suspect to be arrested has entered into or is within any house or place, the person residing in or being in charge of the house or place shall, on demand by the police officer or person acting for the police officer, allow him free access to the house or place and afford all reasonable facilities to search the house or place for the suspect sought to be arrested. \n
\nFurther, <i>section 12(2) ACJA 2015</i> provides that where access to a house or place cannot be obtained under subsection (1) of this section, the person or police officer may enter the house or place and search it for the suspect to be arrested, and in order to effect an entrance into the house or place, may break open any outer or inner door or window of any house or place, whether that of the suspect to be arrested or of any other person or otherwise effect entry into such house or place, if after notification of his authority and purpose, and demand of admittance duly made, he cannot obtain admittance.\n
\n By <i>section 12(3) (a) and (b) of the Act</i>, where the suspect to be arrested enters a house or place in the actual occupancy of another person being a woman who by custom or religious practice does not appear in public, the person making the arrest shall:\n
\n a. Before entering the house or place, give notice to the woman that she is at liberty to withdraw; and \n
\nb. Afford her every reasonable opportunity and facility for withdrawing, and may then enter the house or place, but the notice shall not be necessary where the person making the arrest is a woman.\n
\nSimilarly, by virtue of <i>section 149(6) ACJA 2015</i>, where a place to be searched is a building physically occupied by a woman who, according to custom or religion does not appear in public, the person making the search shall, before entering the building, give notice to the woman that she may withdraw and shall afford her every reasonable facility for withdrawing and may then enter the building.\n
\nFinally, under <i>section 13 of the Act</i>, a police officer or any other person authorised to make an arrest has authority to break out of a house or place in order to liberate himself or any other person who, having lawfully entered for the purpose of making an arrest, is detained in the house or place.\n
\n<b>Circumstances under which the police can arrest without warrant</b>
\n Note that a police may arrest without an order of a court and warrant. This is on the authority of section 18(1) (a) ACJA 2015. See section 10(1) CPA. By virtue of section 18(1) (a) – (l) ACJA 2015, the police is empowered to effect arrest without warrant under the following circumstances:\n
\n a. Where the police officer suspects a person on reasonable grounds of having committed an offence against a law in Nigeria or against the law of any other country, unless the law creating the offence provides that the suspect cannot be arrested without a warrant;\n
\n b. The police can arrest a person who commits any offence in the presence of the police officer;\n
\nc.  The police can effect arrest without warrant on a person who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty, or who has escaped or attempts to escape from lawful custody;\n
\n d. A police officer is empowered to arrest without warrant any person in whose possession anything is found which may reasonably be suspected to be stolen property or who may reasonably be suspected of having committed an offence with reference to the thing;\n
\ne. A police officer can also arrest without warrant a person whom he suspects on reasonable grounds of being a deserter from any of the armed forces of Nigeria; \n
\nf. Any person whom he suspects on reasonable grounds of having been involved in an act committed at a place outside of Nigeria which, if committed in Nigeria, would have been punished as an offence, and for which he is, under a law in force in Nigeria, liable to be apprehended and detained in Nigeria;\n
\n g. Any person having in his possession without lawful excuse, the burden of proving which excuse shall lie on such person, any implement of housebreaking, car theft, firearm or any offensive or dangerous weapon;\n
\nh. Any person whom he has reasonable cause to believe a warrant of arrest has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction in Nigeria;\n
\n i. Any person found in Nigeria taking precautions to conceal his presence in circumstances, which afford reason to believe that he is taking such precautions with a view to committing an offence;\n
\n j. Any person whose arrest a warrant has been issued or whom he is directed to arrest by a Judge, Magistrate, Justice of the Peace or superior police officer;\n
\nk. Any person whom he reasonably suspects to be designing to commit an offence for which the police may arrest without a warrant, if it appears to him that the commission of the offence cannot be otherwise prevented; or\n
\nl. Any person required to appear by a public summons issued under this Act or any other Act. \n
\nm. By virtue of section 19(1) ACJA, where a suspect who, in the presence of a police officer, has committed or has been accused of committing an offence triable summarily, refuses on demand of the officer to give his name and residential address, or gives a name or residential address which the officer has reason to believe to be false, he may be arrested by the officer without warrant in order that his name or residential address may be ascertained.\n
\nThe law that a police may arrest without warrant was given judicial affirmation in the case of <i>State v. Osler [1991] 6 NWLR (Pt., 199) 576.</i>

    <string name="search">Searches And Search Warrant</string>
    <string name="search1">Search consists of looking and seeking out that which is concealed. The essence of search in the criminal justice process is to obtain evidence with which to prosecute an alleged offender. A police officer is empowered to search persons, premises or things.\n
\n By virtue of <i>section 28 of the Police Act</i>, they have power to search property. Subsection (1) of that section provides inter alia that a superior police officer may by authority under his hand authorise any police officer to enter any house, shop, warehouse, or other premises in search of stolen property.\n
\n<i>Section 9(1) (a) ACJA 2015</i> provides that where a suspect is arrested by a police officer or a private person, the officer making the arrest or to whom the private person hands over the suspect may search the suspect, using such force as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose.\n
\n<i> Section 29 of the Police Act</i> provides that a police officer may detain and search any person whom he reasonably suspects of having in his possession or conveying in any manner anything which he has reason to believe to have been stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained.\n
\n By virtue of <i>section 9(2) (a) – (d) ACJA 2015</i>, a police officer is empowered to search a person where he has reasonable grounds for believing that a suspect has on his person any:\n
\n a. Stolen article; \n
\nb. Instrument of violence or poisonous substance; \n
\nc. Tools connected with the kind of offence which he is alleged to have committed; or \n
\nd. Other articles which may furnish evidence against him in regard to the offence, which he is alleged to have committed.\n
<i>See COP v. Obolo [1989] 5 NWLR (Pt. 120)</i>\n
\nAccording to section 9(3) ACJA 2015, where it is necessary to search a suspect, the search shall be carried out decently and by a person of the same sex unless the urgency of the situation demands otherwise. Thus, in searching the body of a woman, the search should be carried out by a woman. \n
\nUnder <i>section 149(6) ACJA 2015</i>, where a place to be searched is a building physically occupied by a woman who, according to custom or religion does not appear in public, the person making the search shall, before entering the building, give notice to the woman that she may withdraw and shall afford her every reasonable facility for withdrawing and may then enter the building\n
\n<b>SEARCH WARRANTS</b>
\n The police officer or any other law enforcement officer must arm himself with a search warrant before conducting a search on a place or premises. By virtue of <i>section 143 ACJA 2015</i>, where an investigation under this Act is being made by a police officer, he may apply to a court or Justice of the Peace within the local limits of whose jurisdiction he is for the issue of a search warrant.\n
\n<b>Circumstances under which Search Warrant may be issued</b>\n
\n A court or Justice of the Peace is empowered by virtue of <i>section 144(1) ACJA 2015</i> to issue search warrant if he is satisfied by information on oath and in writing that there is reasonable ground for believing that there is in any building, ship, carriage, receptacle, motor vehicle, aircraft or place:\n
 \na. anything upon or in respect of which any offence has been or is suspected to have been committed, \n
\nb. anything which there is reasonable ground for believing will provide evidence as to the commission of an offence, or \n
\nc. anything which there is reasonable ground for believing is intended to be used for the purpose of committing an offence,\n
\n<b> Authority of a search warrant</b>
\n By virtue of <i>section 144(2) ACJA 2015</i>, a search warrant issued under subsection (1) of this section shall authorize the officer of the court, a police officer, or other person named to: \n
\na. Search such building, ship, carriage, receptacle, motor vehicle, aircraft or place for any such thing, and to seize any such thing until further trial proceeding before the court issuing the search warrant or some other court to be dealt with according to law; and\n
\nb. Arrest the occupier of the house or place where the thing was found where the court deems fit to direct on the warrant\n
\n <b>Duration of a search warrant</b>
 \nBy virtue of <i>section 146(2) ACJA</i>, a search warrant remains in force until executed or cancelled by the court which issued it. Time when search warrant may be issued and executed\n
\nBy the provisions of <i>section 148 ACJA 2015</i>, a search warrant may be issued and executed at any time on any day, including a Sunday or public holiday\n
\n<b>Condition for execution of search warrant</b>
\n A search under this Part shall, except the court or Justice of the Peace owing to the nature of the case otherwise directs, be made in the presence of two witnesses and the person to whom the search warrant is addressed may also provide a witness within the neighbourhood. This is on the authority of <i>section 149(4) ACJA</i> \n
\nBy the provisions of <i>section 149(5) ACJA 2015</i>, a list of all things found on his person and seized shall be drawn up by the person carrying out the search and shall be signed or sealed by the person to whom the search warrant is addressed, the person executing the search warrant, the witnesses and a witnessed copy of the list shall be delivered to the person searched\n
\n<b>Sentencing and Punishment</b>
\n Upon a finding of “Guilty” the court asks the accused (now a convict) if he/she has anything to say why a sentence should not be passed on him/her according to law. This is what is usually referred to as ―Allocutus‖. The Court receives evidence of accused‘s antecedent. This comprises of evidence of any thing in the convicts favour, date of birth, education, employment, domestic and family life, circumstances, general reputation and association, date of arrest, whether he/she has been on bail or remand or if previously convicted, the date of last discharge. The totality of this information enables the court to arrive at an appropriate sentence.\n
\n<b>Meaning of Sentence</b>
\n Sentence is the punishment handed down to a convict for the crime committed by a court of competent jurisdiction.<i> Section 401(1) ACJA 2015</i> provides thus: ―Subject to the provisions of a law relating to a specific offence or class of offence and to the jurisdiction conferred on any court or on a person presiding over the court, the provisions in this part shall apply to sentences of death, imprisonment, fine, and non-custodial sentences.‖\n
\n<b>Objectives of sentencing</b>
\n By the provisions of <i>section 401(2) (a) – (d) ACJA</i>, in determining a sentence, the court shall have the following objectives in mind, and may decide in each case the objectives that are more appropriate or even possible:\n
\n(a) Prevention, that is, the objective of persuading the convict to give up committing offence in the future, because the consequences of crime is unpleasant; \n
\n(b) Restraint, that is, the objective of keeping the convict from committing more offence by isolating him from society. This objective is also referred to as disablement. Sometimes punishments are imposed in order to disable the accused person. This means that the accused person upon the imposition of punishment, e.g. imprisonment, is removed from the society so as to deny him of the opportunity to commit further crime against the society. \n
\n(c) Rehabilitation, that is, the objective of providing the convict with treatment or training that will make him into a reformed citizen. This objective is two edged instrument. The purpose of this is to make him useful to himself and the society so that he would voluntarily refrain from committing crime. In order to achieve this, it is common to assign a probation officer to the convict who will monitor or supervise his progress in becoming a responsible member of the society over a period of time. \n
\n(d) Deterrence, that is, the objective of warning others not to commit offence by making an example of the convict. The principle of deterrence which is at present probably the most effective principle of punishment takes two forms. Punishment may be imposed in order to discourage the particular accused from offending again, or with the aim of discouraging the general public from doing what the accused did. In this way, knowing how severe the punishment may be, a criminally minded person would rather avoid committing the offence in the light of the consequences that go with it.\n
\n(e) Education of the public, that is, the objective of making a clear distinction between good and bad conduct by punishing bad conduct. Sometimes, punishments are imposed with the objective of educating the people on the evils of committing a particular kind of conduct.\n
\n(f) Retribution, that is, the objective of giving the convict the punishment he deserves, and giving the society or the victim revenge. This view involves a process of ―looking back‖ at the circumstances of the crime committed, and deciding what punishment the accused deserves for his conduct, having regard to his responsibility for the crime. Punishment in this respect is meant to teach the accused person that crime does not pay\n
\n(g) Restitution, that is, the objective of compensating the victim or family of the victim of the offence.\n
\n<b>Types of Sentence</b>\n
\n There are different types of sentences. These include;\n
\n1. Death sentence\n
\n2. Imprisonment\n
\n3. Fines \n
\n4. Caning \n
\n5. Deportation \n
\n6. Binding order \n
\n7. Conditional discharge\n
\n8. Probation order \n
\n9. Police supervision \n
\n10. Compensation or restitution \n
\n11. Payment of prosecution cost \n
\n12. Compensation for vexatious and frivolous prosecution\n
\n13. Haddi lashing\n
\n<b>Death sentence</b>
\n It is no doubt that the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015 boasts of certain innovations. The provisions of <i>Section 402 of the ACJA</i> deals with death sentence. Persons who have been found guilty of capital offences are usually sentenced to death. It is settled under Nigerian law that the consequence of a finding of guilt of a defendant by a competent court of law on capital offences attract death sentence. The mandatory nature of the sentence and the way it is being done has propped up a number of issues in the past, including the proper way a court is to pronounce how the judgment is to be carried out. This position has been known to be by way of hanging by the neck according to provisions of <i>Sections 367 (2) of the CPA and section 273 of the CPC.</i>\n
\nWhere the pronouncement of sentence of death is not passed in the manner prescribed by the law, the defendant can effectively challenge his sentence. <i>Olowofeyeku v. State (1984) 5 SC 192</i>\n
\nThe duty of the court to state the exact manner in which a convict should be executed was emphasised in <i>Gano v. State (1968) 1 All NLR 353; (1968) NSCC 285</i>. Lethal injection involves administration of a combination of poisonous substances into a person, usually by way of drugs for the purpose of causing immediate death. The lethal injection has stages; it first puts the convict to sleep and then attacks the heart to stop breathing.\n
\nOn the authority of <i>section 404 ACJA 2015</i>, where a woman found guilty of a capital offence is pregnant, the sentence of death shall be passed on her but its execution shall be suspended until the baby is delivered and weaned.\n
\nSimilarly, by <i>section 405 ACJA 2015</i>, where a convict who, in the opinion of the court, had not attained the age of 18 years at the time the offence was committed is found guilty of a capital offence, sentence of death shall not be pronounced or recorded but in lieu of it, the court shall sentence the child to life imprisonment or to such other term as the court may deem appropriate in consideration of the principles set out in section 401 of this Act. That section concerns adopting the objectives of sentencing that is appropriate or even possible such as prevention, restraint, rehabilitation, deterrence, education, retribution, restitution, etc. <i>Modupe Johnson v. The State [1988] 4 NWLR (Pt. 87) 130</i>\n
\nBy <i>section 407 ACJA 2015</i>, a Judge who pronounces a sentence of death shall issue, under his hand and the seal of the court, a certificate to the effect that sentence of death has been pronounced upon the convict named in the certificate, and the certificate shall be sufficient and full authority in law for the detention of the convict in safe custody until the sentence of death pronounced upon him can be carried into effect and for carrying the sentence of death into effect in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Part.\n
\n<b>Imprisonment</b>
\n On conviction, a court may sentence the convict to a term of imprisonment as prescribed by the law. This is on the authority of <i>section 416(1) ACJA 2015</i>. Subsection (2) (a) – (k) of the same section provide as follows: In exercising its discretion of sentencing or review of sentence, the court  shall take into consideration the following factors, in addition to the provisions of section 401 of this Act:\n
\n(a) each case shall be treated on its own merit; \n
\n(b) the objectives of sentencing, including the principles of reformation, shall be borne in mind in sentencing a convict; \n
\n(c) an appeal court may, in a proper case, reduce the sentence imposed by the trial court, especially where it is excessive or based on wrong principles, or an appeal court may increase the sentence imposed by the trial court especially where it is inadequate;\n
\n(d) a trial court shall not pass the maximum sentence on a first offender; \n
\n(e) the period spent in prison custody awaiting or undergoing trial shall be considered and computed in sentencing a convict;\n
\n (f) trial court shall conduct an inquiry into the convict‘s antecedents before sentencing; \n
\n(g) it may be desirable to adjourn for sentencing in order to have time to consider any evidence adduced at the sentencing hearing in accordance with section 311 of this Act;\n
\n(h) where there is doubt as to whether the defendant or convict has attained the age of 18, the court should resolve the doubt in his favour;\n
\n (i) a defendant may not be given consecutive sentences for two or more offences committed in the same transaction; \n
\n(j) an appeal court may not increase the sentence of a lower court beyond the maximum number of years the lower court has power to impose; and\n
\n (k) sentencing to a term of imprisonment shall apply only to those offenders who should be isolated from society and with whom other forms of punishment have failed or is likely to fail.\n
\n<b>Fines</b>
\n The sentence for a particular offence may be a fine or imprisonment or both. <i>Section 422 (a) and (b) ACJA 2015</i> provides that a defendant convicted of an offence punishable by: (a) imprisonment as well as fine, and sentenced to pay a fine, whether with or without imprisonment, or (b) imprisonment or fine, and sentenced to pay a fine, may be ordered to serve imprisonment, in default of payment of the fine, for a certain term, which imprisonment shall be in addition to any other imprisonment to which he may have been sentenced.\n
\nHowever, where he defaults in paying the fine, he may be ordered to serve prison term. <i>Goke v. IGP (1957) WNLR 80</i>\n
\nUnder <i>section 424 ACJA</i>, the court also has power of awarding imprisonment in default of payment of penalty for a summary conviction. That section provides that where by any law, the court is empowered to impose a penalty for a summary conviction offence, it may, in the absence of express provisions to the contrary in the same or any other law, order a defendant who is convicted of such offence, in default of payment of the sum of money adjudged to be paid under the order, either immediately or at the time specified in the order, as the case may be, to be imprisoned, in accordance with the scale set out in the Fourth Schedule to this Act.\n
\n<i>Section 427(1) and (2) (a) – (c) ACJA 2015</i> provides that:\n
\n (1) A court, in fixing the amount of a fine to be imposed on a convict, shall take into consideration, amongst other things, the means of the convict.\n
\n (2) Where a fine is imposed, the payment of the court fees and other legal expenses payable in the case, up to and including conviction, shall not be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of the fine or be imposed in addition to the fine, but the amount of the fine or of such part as may be paid or recovered, shall be applied as follows:\n
\n(a) in the first instance, in the payment to the informant or complainant of any court or other fees paid by him and ordered by the court to be repaid to him;\n
\n (b) in the second instance, the payment of any outstanding court fee not already paid by the informant or complainant which may be payable under rules of court; and\n
\n(c) the balance, if any, remaining after the payments have been made shall be paid into general revenue of the Federation\n
\n<b>Detention in a Safe Custody or Suitable Place other than Prison or Mental Health Asylum</b>
\n<i>Section 438(1) – (3) ACJA 2015</i> spells out the conditions attached to detention in a safe custody or suitable place other than prison or mental asylum. That section provides as follows: \n
\n(1) Where a person is ordered to be detained in a safe custody or suitable place other than prison or mental health asylum, he is, notwithstanding anything in this Act or in any other law, liable to be detained in a prison or asylum or such other place as provided under this Act or any law as the Attorney-General of the Federation may direct and whilst so detained shall be deemed to be in legal custody.\n
\n(2) A person detained in a safe custody or suitable place other than prison or mental health asylum may at any time be discharged by the Attorney-General of the Federation on licence. \n
\n(3) The Attorney-General of the Federation may at any time revoke or vary a licence and where a licence has been revoked, the person to whom the licence relates shall proceed to such place as the AttorneyGeneral of the Federation may direct and if he fails to do so may be arrested without warrant and taken to the place. This subsection tells us that the Attorney-General of the Federation has power to revoke or vary the licence at any time.\n
\n<b>Deportation</b>
\n Deportation means the legal expulsion or removal from Nigeria of a person not being a citizen. <i>Section 439 ACJA</i> 2015 defines it thus: ―In this Part, ―deport‖ with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, means the legal expulsion or removal from Nigeria of a person not being a citizen, to his country.‖\n
\n<i>Section 441 ACJA 2015</i> is concerned with deportation in default of security for the peace. That section provides that where, on a sworn information, it appears to a court that there is reason to believe that a person in Nigeria who is not a citizen of Nigeria is about to commit a breach of the peace, or that his conduct is likely to produce or excite a breach of the peace, the court, after due inquiry at which the defendant concerned shall be present, may order him to give security in two or more sureties for peace and good behaviour, and in default, may recommend to the Minister of Interior that the defendant be deported.\n
\n<i>Section 442 (a) – (c) ACJA 2015</i> deals with deportation in case of dangerous conduct\n
\n<i>Section 443(1) and (2) ACJA 2015</i> state the procedure prior to court recommending deportation under sections 441 and 442.\n
\nThe Minister of Interior is empowered under <i>section 446 ACJA 2015</i> in the interest of peace, order and good governance make an order of deportation and issue a written order directing that the defendant referred to in sections 441 and 442 of this Act be deported to his country. \n
\nBy virtue of <i>section 448 ACJA 2015</i>, a citizen of Nigeria cannot be deported to a place outside Nigeria. In other words, no citizen of Nigeria by birth should be regarded as a foreigner or be repatriated from Nigeria. This statutory provision was judicial affirmed in the case of <i>Alhaji Shugaba v. Minister of Internal Affairs [1981] 2 NCLR 459</i>\n
\n<i>Section 449 ACJA 2015</i> provides that where a defendant ordered to be deported is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, the sentence of imprisonment shall be served before the order of deportation is carried into effect.\n
\n Finally, <i>section 451(1) and (2) ACJA 2015</i> provide for the execution of deportation order.\n
\n<b>Child Offenders</b>
\n Under <i>section 452(1) ACJA 215</i>, where a child is alleged to have committed an offence, the provisions of the Child Rights Act shall apply. Under subsection (2) of this section, notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the provisions of this Act relating to bail shall apply to bail proceedings of a child offender\n
\nBy <i>section 454(1) (a) – (c) ACJA 2015</i>, where a defendant is charged before a court with an offence punishable by law and the court thinks that the charge is proved but is of opinion that having regard to:\n
\n (a) the character, antecedents, age, health, or mental condition of the defendant charged,\n
\n(b) the trivial nature of the offence, or \n
\n(c) the extenuating circumstances under which the offence was committed, the court may make an order dismissing the charge; or discharging the defendant conditionally on his entering into a recognizance, with or without sureties, to be of good behaviour and ask him to pay for compensation for loss or damage/injury caused.\n
\n<i>Section 455(1) – (3) ACJA 2015</i> provides for probation orders and conditions of recognizance.\n
\n<i>Section 460(1) – (4) ACJA 2015</i> provides for suspended sentence and community service\n
\n<i>Section 461(1) – (9) ACJA 2015</i> provides for arrangement for community service.\n
\n<i>Section 462(1) – (4) ACJA 2015 provides for performance of community service order</i>\n
\nUnder <i>section 467(1) ACJA 2015</i>, a defendant convicted of an offence triable summarily may be sentenced and ordered to serve the sentence at a Rehabilitation and Correctional Centre established by the Federal Government in lieu of imprisonment. A court in making an order of confinement at a Rehabilitation and Correctional Centre is empowered under subsection (2) (a) – (c) of this section to have regard to: (a) the age of the convict; (b) the fact that the convict is a first offender; and (c) any other relevant circumstance necessitating an order of confinement at a Rehabilitation and Correctional Centre.\n
\nFinally, by virtue of subsection (3) of this section, a court may make an order directing that a child standing criminal trial be remanded at Rehabilitation and Correctional Centre\n
\n<b>Caning </b>\n
\nCaning may be in addition to or in lieu of imprisonment and shall not exceed twelve strokes of the cane and shall be with light rod.\n
\n A woman shall not be sentenced to caning –<i> see section 6.. CPA</i>.\n
\n Similarly, a convict of 25 years and above shall not be sentenced to caning. See <i>section 385 CPA. </i>\n
\n<b>Haddi lashing</b>\n
\n Haddi lashing is employed for offences that are not serious in nature especially, for offences bordering on immorality. The aim is not to punish per se but to disgrace the offender.

    <string name="offesteal">Offences Against Property: Stealing</string>
    <string name="offesteal1"><b>Introduction</b>
\n One of the aims of criminal law is the protection of property. The protection comes in different ways and one of this is through the offence of stealing. The law therefore makes it an offence for you to take a property belonging to another person without the person‘s consent given freely. The offence of stealing is one that is frowned at in all parts of the world, including Nigeria and constitutes an offence in all jurisdictions. Apart from being a crime, stealing is an act that is viewed as morally wrong. Thus, both the Criminal Code (CC) and the Penal Code (PC) criminalizes the act of stealing.\n
\n<b>Stealing Defined</b>
\n According to <i>section 383(1) of the Criminal Code</i> (hereinafter referred to as CC) when a person fraudulently takes anything capable of being stolen, or fraudulently converts to his own use or to the use of any other person anything capable of being stolen, is said to steal that thing.\n
\n<i> Section 383(2) CC</i> defines it further thus: ―A person who takes or converts anything capable of being stolen is deemed to do so fraudulently if he does so with any of the following intents –\n
\n a. An intent permanently to deprive the owner of the thing of it; \n
\nb. An intent permanently to deprive any person who has any special property in the thing of such property\n
\n c. An intent to use the thing as a pledge or security \n
\nd. An intent to part with it on a condition as to its return which the person taking or converting it may be unable to perform; \n
\ne. An intent to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be returned in the condition in which it was at the time of the taking or conversion; in the case of money, an intent to use it at the will of the person who takes or converts it, although he may intend afterwards to repay the amount to the owner. \n
\nFrom the above definition, for the offence of stealing to be committed, mens rea/mental element is fundamental. In either case of taking or converting, the intention to permanently deprive the owner of such property of it, an intent permanently to deprive any person who has any special property in the thing of such property, an intent to use the thing as a pledge or security, an intent to part with it on a condition as to its return which the person taking or converting it may be unable to perform, an intent to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be returned in the condition in which it was at the time of the taking or conversion; in the case of money, an intent to use it at the will of the person who takes or converts it, although he may intend afterwards to repay the amount to the owner. These intents must exist on the part of the offender; otherwise this will not amount to stealing.\n
\n<b>Things capable of being stolen</b>
\n The thing stolen must be capable of being stolen and section 382 CC contains several examples of such things. According to the section, every non-living thing which is the property of another and is capable of being made movable is capable of being stolen. Going by the statement above that the thing stolen must be capable of being stolen; it means that is not every property that is capable of being stolen. For instance, one cannot steal land because it is an immovable property and therefore not capable of being stolen. <i>Ojiko v. IGP (1956) 1 FSC 62,</i>\n
\nTo constitute stealing, the item or property must belong to another person. That is, it must have owner. An ownerless property or property which is abandoned is not capable of being owned at all, and as such cannot be said to be owned by anybody is not capable of being stolen.\n
\nAlso, living things, like animals, whether domestic, wild by nature or tamed, such as dog, ostrich or monkey are capable being stolen, because section 1 CC defines property to include everything animate or inanimate, capable of being the subject of ownership. It must however be noted that if wild animals are in the enjoyment of their natural habitat they are not capable of being stolen but their dead bodies are. It therefore means that if a man goes hunting in the forest and captured a gorilla, he cannot be said to have stolen it, except if the forest is a reserved one where hunting is prohibited.\n
\n<b>Elements of Stealing</b>
\n By this, we mean the ingredient that constitutes stealing. For an act to amount to stealing, some elements must be present or follow the act.\n
\n<b>Taking</b>
\n Taking in this sense does not mean that the person alleged to have stolen should have had in his or her possession, the thing said to be stolen. It is sufficient if the person accused of stealing merely moves or cause the property to be moved with the intention of stealing it\n
\n<b>Conversion</b>
\n In the absence of taking, there must be a “conversion” of property. Conversion in this sense is as defined at common law, which according to Atkin J. in <i>Lancashire and York Railway Company v. McNicol (1919) 88 L.K. 601 at 605</i> is dealing with goods in a manner inconsistent with the right of the true owner provided there is an intention on the part of the person converting the property to deny the owner‘s right or to assert a right which is inconsistent with that of the owner.\n
\n<b>Fraudulent Intention</b>\n
\n In addition to the “taking” or “conversion” of property, the intention to defraud (which is the mens rea in this instance) must be present or accompany such acts on the part of the person taking or converting any property. Otherwise this will not amount to stealing. Such intention may not be immediately present at the initial time of taking or converting the property but it is sufficient if the person thereafter forms that intention.  <i>Oshinye v. COP (1960) 5 F.S.C. 105</i>\n
\nIn order to ascertain whether the intention of the person taking or converting any property was fraudulent or dishonest at that material time, any of the following intentions must be present:\n
\n 1. An intention permanently to deprive the owner of the thing of it. If the intent is merely to deprive the owner temporarily, it is not stealing unless there is also any of the other intents set out in section 383(2) CC. <i>R. v. Easom (1971) 2 All E.R. 945</i>\n
\n2. An intent permanently to deprive any person who has any special property in the thing of such property: here, any intent on the part of the person taking or converting property to deprive any person who although is not the owner of the property but has such special interest in it, such as in the case of a bailee (a person entrusted with goods under a contract of bailment) or chargee, etc., in which the person holding possession is equally entitled to benefit in the property, will amount to stealing\n
\n3. An intent to use the thing as a pledge or security. No reported case has been found under this head. But it seems that if A takes B‘s property and pledges them or gives them to C as security for loan of money, this will amount to stealing. It will be deemed that the former fraudulently took the property. \n
\n4. An intent to part with it on a condition as to its return which the person taking or converting it may be unable to perform. Supposed X who has never driven a car tells Y that he can drive properly and Y doubts this. Then they make a bet and Y stakes his wrist watch and X who has no wrist watch takes Z‘s wrist watch from a nearby table and stakes it. The watches are handed over to A on condition that he is to give both of them to the winner of the bet. This will amount to stealing under this head.\n
\n5. An intent to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be returned in the condition in which it was at the time of the taking or conversion.\n
\n6. In the case of money, an intent to use it at the will of the person who takes or converts it, although he may intend afterwards to repay the amount to the owner. In <i>State v. Odimayo (1967) NMLR 92, </i>the accused received a loan from a Housing Corporation to build a house on a piece of land which he mortgaged to the Corporation. He used the money instead to contest an election. He was convicted of stealing the money. It made no difference that he might have intended to repay it afterwards.\n
\n7. In the case of lost property, if a person finds such property and coverts it, this will not be regarded as fraudulent if at the time of converting it he did not know who is the true owner or if he reasonably believe that owner cannot be found.\n
\n<b>Secrecy or Concealment</b>
\n It is important to mention that secrecy is not a necessary elementof the offence of stealing. In effect, stealing can still be constituted even when the act was done in the open as long as it was done without the consent of the owner. This assertion is encapsulated under <i>section 383(3) CC</i> which is to the effect that the taking or conversion may be fraudulent, although it is effected without secrecy or attempts at concealment.\n
\n<b>The Rule about Finder-Keeper</b>
\n By virtue of <i>section 383(5) CC</i>, when a thing converted has been lost by the owner and found by the person who converts it, the conversion is not deemed to be fraudulent if at the time of the conversion the person taking or converting the thing does not know who is the owner, and believes on reasonable grounds that the owner cannot be discovered.\n
\n<b>Exceptions to the Rule about finder Keeper</b>
\n The rule about finder-keeper has certain exceptions. For the rule to apply, there must be reasonable grounds for believes that the owner of the property cannot be discovered. In effect, once the identity of the owner is known, the rule about finder – keeper would be inoperable\n
\nWhere a person who has no capacity to give a consent eventually does, such consent is vitiated as a result of such lack of capacity. If any property is obtained under such circumstance, it would be deemed to have been fraudulently appropriated.\n
\nBy virtue of <i>section 384(2) CC</i>, when a servant, contrary to his master\'s orders, takes from his possession any food in order that it may be given to an animal belonging to or in the possession of his master, such taking is not deemed to be stealing. This is an exception to the rule concerning stealing.\n
\n<b>Punishments of Stealing</b>
\n The punishment for stealing where no other punishment is stipulated by law is three years imprisonment. <i>Section 390 CC</i> provides that any person who steals anything capable of being stolen, is guilty of a felony and is liable, if no other punishment is provided, to imprisonment for three years.\n
\n<b>Stealing Wills</b>
 \nThere are however stiffer penalty of an imprisonment for life where the thing stolen concerns wills, postal matters or relating to property, etc. Section 390(1) CC provides that if the thing stolen is a testamentary instrument, whether the testator is living or dead, the offender is liable to imprisonment for life.\n

\n<b>Stealing by clerks and servants</b>
\n By the tenor of subsection (6) of section 390, if the offender is a clerk or servant and the thing stolen is the property of his employer or came into the possession of the offender on account of his employer, he is liable to imprisonment for seven years.\n

\n By virtue of subsection (8), if the thing stolen is any of the following things‐\n
\n (a) property which has been received by the offender with a power of attorney for the disposition thereof; \n
\n(b) property which has been entrusted to the offender either alone or jointly with any other person for him to retain in safe custody or to apply, pay or deliver for any purpose or to any person the same or any part thereof or any proceeds thereof;\n
\n (c) property which has been received by the offender either alone or jointly with any other person for or on account of any other person; \n
\n(d) the whole or part of the proceeds of any valuable security which has been received by the offender with a direction that the proceeds thereof should be applied to any purpose or paid to any person specified in the direction;\n
\n (e) the whole or part of the proceeds arising from any disposition of any property which have been received by the offender by virtue of a power of attorney for such disposition, such power of attorney having been received by the offender with a direction that such proceeds should be applied to any purpose or paid to any person specified in the direction, the offender is liable to imprisonment for seven years.\n

\n2. there must be demands. This may be oral or written or may be by gesture. Where however it is a request, it cannot constitute stealing or demanding property with menaces.\n
\n3. There must be threats of violence\n
\nIn <i>R v. Clear (1958) 1 All E.R. 74</i>, the lorry driver threatened to change his testimony in response to a court subpoena if the Managing Director of his company did not give him 300 pounds. He was held liable for demanding property with menaces.\n

\n (c) an assault with intent to have carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature, or an unlawful and indecent assault upon a male person; or\n
\n(d) an attempt to commit the offence of rape, or an assault with intent to commit the offence of rape, or an unlawful and indecent assault upon a woman or girl; or\n
\n(e) a solicitation or threat offered or made to any person as an inducement to commit or permit the commission of any of the offences aforesaid, the offender is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.\n
\n<b>STEALING WITH VIOLENCE (ROBBERY)</b>
\n The offence of robbery is governed by sections 401 and 402 CC.\n
\n<i>Section 401 CC</i> defines robbery thus: any person who steals anything and, at or immediately before or immediately after the time of stealing it, uses or threatens to use actual violence to any person or property in order to obtain or retain the thing stolen or to prevent or overcome resistance to its being stolen or retained, is said to be guilty of robbery. By <i>section 8(1) (a) of the Theft Act of 1968, </i>a person is guilty of robbery if he steals, and immediately before or at the time of doing so, and in order to do so, he uses any force on any person or put or seek to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force.\n
\nRobbery is an aggravated form of stealing. Therefore before a conviction of robbery may be secured, all the elements of stealing must be proved. Where immediately before, during or after the stealing, a person threatens to use or uses actual violence to any person for the purpose of obtaining, retain or preventing or overcoming resistance to its being stolen or retained, is said to be guilty of robbery. Thus, stealing and the use or threatened use of violence constitutes the offence of robbery. In <i>Corcoran v. Anderton (1980) 71 Crim. App Rep 104</i>, the defendant was tugging with the victim‘s handbag but later dropped it and decamped (took off). The court held that robbery has occurred. This is because by taking hold of the handbag of the victim, he had appropriated it\n
\nWhere several persons go to steal and one of them, unknown to the others, uses violence, those others are guilty not of robbery but of stealing unless it can be shown that they were party to the use of violence. This was the position of the court in <i>Ugboaja v. COP (1967) 7 ERNLR 153.</i>\n
\nThe defence of honest claim of right is available to a person who is charged with robbery. Where an accused believed that he has a legal right to deprive the victim of the property, he cannot be held liable for robbery. In <i>R v. Hemmings (1865) 4 F &amp; F 50</i>, the accused, a creditor, severely beats up his debtor and compels him to pay up on the spot, it was held that the act did not constitute robbery\n
\n<b>Punishment of Robbery</b>
\nThe punishment for robbery is provided under <i>section 402(1) CC</i>. the section provides that any person who commits the offence of robbery shall upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than 21 years.

    <string name="armedrob">Armed Robbery, Burglary and Like Offences</string>
    <string name="armedrob1">Where a person uses or threatens violence while armed with a firearm or other offensive weapon to obtain property, the offence of armed robbery is constituted. The firearm or offensive weapon must be in possession of the offender immediately and during the act which constitute the offence.\n
\n<i> Section 403B CC</i> gave an embracing definition of firearms and offensive weapons. Accordingly, the section defines "firearms" to include any canon, gun, flint‐lock gun, revolver, pistol, explosive or ammunition or other firearm, whether whole or in detached pieces; "offensive weapon" means any article, apart from a firearm, made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person or intended by the person having it for such use by him and it includes an air gun, air pistol, bow and arrow, spear, cutlass, machete, dagger, cudgel, or any piece of wood, metal, glass or stone capable of being used as an offensive weapon.\n
\nIn the case of <i>State v. Okonkwo (1998) 1 LRCNCC 37</i>, the court held that armed robbery is committed where at the time of the commission of the robbery the accused is proved to have been armed with firearms or offensive weapons. Any person in company of a person so armed, or aiding and abetting in the commission of the offence is similarly guilty.\n
\nThe defence of honest claim of right is available to a person who is charged with armed robbery. Where an accused believed that he has a legal right to deprive the victim of the property, he cannot be held liable for armed robbery. This rule was given judicial affirmation in <i>R v. Robinson</i>\n
\n<b>Punishment for Armed Robbery</b>
\n The punishment for armed robbery is provided under <i>section 402(2) CC</i>. it is provided that if any offender mentioned in subsection (1) of this section is armed with any firearms or any offensive weapon or any obnoxious or chemical materials or is in company with any person so armed; or at or immediately before or immediately after the time of robbery the said offender wounds any person, the offender shall upon conviction be sentenced to death.\n
\n<b>BURGLARY, HOUSEBREAKING AND LIKE OFFENCES</b>
\n The protection offers property by law extends to dwelling houses and property contained in them. The law makes the acts of breaking and entering into the house of another with the intention of committing a crime in it an offence. This offence also covers situation where someone enters a building and after committing a crime in it breaks out of it.\n
\n<b>Breaking and Entering</b>
\n Under <i>section 410 CC</i>, a person who breaks any part, whether external or internal, of a building, or opens by unlocking, pulling, pushing, lifting, or any other means whatever, any door, window, shutter, cellar flap, or other thing, intended to close or cover an opening in a building, or an opening giving passage from one part of a building to another, is said to break the building.\n
\nA person who obtains entrance into a building by means of any threat or artifice used for that purpose, or by collusion with any person in the building, or who enters any chimney or other aperture of the building permanently left open for any necessary purpose, but not intended to be ordinarily used as a means of entrance, is deemed to have broken and entered the building.\n
\nIt is also important to note here that where a person extends the boundary within which he is authorized, he is deemed to break into the building.\n
\n<i>Section 411 CC</i> defines housebreaking and burglary thus: Any person who‐ \n
\n(1) breaks and enters the dwelling‐house of another with intent to commit a felony therein; or \n
\n(2) having entered the dwelling‐house of another with intent to commit a felony therein, or having committed a felony in the dwelling‐house of another, breaks out of the dwelling‐house, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.\n
\nIf the offence is committed in the night, the offender is liable to imprisonment for life.\n
\n<b>House Breaking and Burglary Distinguished</b>
\n It is important to state that the offence of burglary have the same ingredients as that of housebreaking. The basic difference between house breaking and burglary is time of the day in which the offence is committed. If the offence is committed in the day, (that is between 6:30am and 6:30pm) it is house breaking, but where the offence is committed in the night (that is, between 6:30pm and 6:30am) it is burglary.\n
\nUnder <i>section 347 of the Penal Code</i>, for the offence to be burglary it must be committed between sunset and sunrise.\n
\n<b>Elements/Ingredients of Housebreaking/Burglary</b>
\n The essential ingredients to prove the offence of housebreaking are, that the building in question is a dwelling-house, intent to commit a felony (a crime), that there is breaking in and/or out, and entry into the building.\n
\n<b> Breaking</b>
\n Breaking is an essential ingredient of both burglary and house breaking. The act of breaking in can be committed by the actual breaking of any external or internal part of a building or by unlocking, pulling, pushing, lifting of a door, window shutter which are ordinarily used for closing or opening a building or used as giving passage to the building or from one part of the building to another.\n
\nThe breaking and the entering need not necessarily occur on the same night. This assertion was judicially recognized in the English case of <i>R v. Smith (1820) R &amp; R 417</i>. Here the breaking was on Friday night and entering was on Saturday night. The accused was held liable for burglary.\n
\nBreaking can be actual or constructive. It is constructive breaking where entrance into a building is obtained by means of a threat or violence or intimidation or by trick, or artifice used for that purpose by collusion with any person in building or if entrance is gained through the chimney or any small opening in the building left open for any necessary purpose, but not intended to be ordinarily used as a means of entrance.\n
\nIf a man leaves the door of his dwelling house open and a thief enters through the same open door, the offence is neither burglary nor house breaking because the element of breaking is lacking. Breaking can be actual or constructive. Where a door is ajar (partially opened) and the thief pushes it further in order to be able to gain entrance into the building, it is breaking (constructive breaking).\n
\n<b>Entering</b>
\n To constitute entering, the whole body of the accused person needs not to have entered the building. It is sufficient if any part of the accused‘s body or any instrument used by him is within the building. Thus there will be entry where the accused person projects his hand, leg, or head inside the building or any instrument used by him. In <i>Bailey (1822) R &amp; R Rep 80</i>, the introduction of a hand between the shutter and the window to undo the window was held sufficient to constitute entry. In <i>Davis (1823) R &amp; R Rep…</i> a young boy pushed his finger against a glass pane of a window in a dwelling house; the pressure caused the glass to fall into the house. An entry was held to have occurred for the purpose of burglary. In <i>James v. Smith (1976) 3 All E.R.54</i>, Smith‘s father gave him blanket permission to enter his house. Smith and his friends entered the house and removed television set. It was treated as entry and they were convicted of burglary\n
\n<b>Intent to commit felony</b>
\n As a necessary ingredient of this offence, the accused person must intend to commit felony (a serious crime) within the building. It need not necessarily be the intent to steal anything from the building but the intent to commit a crime – e.g. murder, rape, arson, etc. must be present at the time of breaking into the building. The usual intent however is to steal and the best proof of such intent is the fact that the felony has actually been committed. The intent must exist at the time of breaking and entering.\n
\n<b>Entering dwelling‐house with intent to commit felony</b>
\n By section 412 CC, any person who enters or is in the dwelling‐house of another with intent to commit a felony therein, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years. If the offence is committed in the night, the offender is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.\n
\n The definition of a dwelling-house includes any building or structure, or part of a building or structure which is for the time being kept by the owner or occupier for the residence therein of himself, his family, or servants, or any of them: it is immaterial that it is, from time to time, uninhabited: The fact that there was nobody living in the building at the time the offence was committed or that the building is not occupied from time to time is irrelevant.\n
\n<b>Breaking into building and committing felony</b>
 \nThe offence of breaking into building and committing felony is provided for under <i>section 413 CC</i>. By the tenor of that provision, any person who:\n
\n (1) breaks and enters a schoolhouse, shop, warehouse, store, office, or counting‐house, or a building which is adjacent to a dwelling‐house and occupied with it but is not part of it, and commits a felony therein; or\n
 \n(2) having committed a felony in a schoolhouse, shop, warehouse, store, office, or counting-house, or in any such other building as last mentioned, breaks out of the building, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years\n
\n<b>Breaking into building with intent to commit felony</b>
\n Under <i>section 414 CC</i>, any person who breaks and enters a schoolhouse, shop, warehouse, store, office, or counting‐house, or a building which is adjacent to a dwelling‐house and occupied with it but is not part of it, with intent to commit a felony therein, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.\n
\n<b>Breaking into place of worship and committing felony </b>
\nBy <i>section 415 CC</i>, any person who breaks and enters a building ordinarily used for religious worship and commits a felony therein, or having committed a felony in any such building breaks out of it, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.\n
\n<b>Breaking into place of worship with intent to commit felony</b>
\n By <i>section 416 CC</i>, any person who breaks and enters a building ordinarily used for religious worship, with intent to commit a felony therein, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.\n
\n<b>Persons found armed, etc., with intent to commit felony</b>
\n By <i>section 417 CC</i>, any person who is found in any of the following circumstances \n
\n(a) being armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon or instrument, and being so armed with intent to break or enter a dwelling‐house, and to commit a felony therein;\n
\n(b) being armed as aforesaid by night, and being so armed with intent to break or enter any building whatever, and to commit a felony therein;\n
\n (c) having in his possession by night without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies on him, any instrument of housebreaking;\n
\n (d) having in his possession by day, any such instrument with intent to commit a felony; \n
\n(e) having his face masked or blackened or being otherwise disguised, with intent to commit a felony;\n
\n(f) being in any building whatever by night with intent to commit a felony therein; or\n
\n (g) being in any building whatever by day with intent to commit a felony therein, and having taken precautions to conceal his presence, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for three years. If the offender has been previously convicted of a felony relating to property, he is liable to imprisonment for seven years.

    <string name="falsepre">Obtaining Property by False Pretences</string>
    <string name="falsepre1"><b>Introduction</b>
\n The aim of the offence of obtaining property by false pretence (otherwise known as ‗419‘ in Nigeria because the offence is contained in section 419 of the Criminal Code Act) is to protect the interest of property owners against fraudulent individuals where such owners gave their consent to the property that was obtained but it turned out that such consent was acquired by false pretence\n
\n<b>Definition of False Pretence</b>
\n<i> Section 418 CC</i> defines false pretence to mean any representation made by words, writing, or conduct, of a matter of fact, either past or present, which representation is false in fact and which the person making it knows to be false or does not believe to be true.\n
\n<b>Obtaining goods by false pretences</b>
\n The offence of obtaining property by false pretence is committed where someone obtains anything capable of being stolen from another person under false pretence with the intention to defraud that person. The offence is also committed where someone by false pretence induces (influence) any person to deliver to another person anything capable of being stolen with the intention to defraud.\n
\n By <i>section 419 CC</i>, any person who by any false pretence, and with intent to defraud, obtains from any other person anything capable of being stolen, or induces any other person to deliver to any person anything capable of being stolen, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for three years. If the thing obtained is of the value of one thousand naira or upwards, he is liable to imprisonment for seven years.\n
\n From the above provisions, only things capable of being stolen can be obtained by false pretences. Therefore, land or intangible things such as job cannot be obtained by false pretences.\n
\n<b>Elements of obtaining property by false pretence</b>
\n For the offence of obtaining property by false pretence to be deemed to have been committed, some elements or ingredients are essential. Some of these elements are discussed hereunder:\n
\n1. there must be a representation (oral or written)\n
\n 2. representation must be false\n
\n3. representation must be fraudulent\n
\n4. intent to defraud\n
\n5. there must be obtaining\n
\n6. the property so obtained must be capable of being stolen\n
\n<i><b>False pretence or representation</b></i>
\nFor the offence of receiving property by false pretence to be constituted, there must be a false representation made by someone with the intention to defraud another through which the other person parted with his/her property or delivers such property at the false pretence of someone to another. In other words, there must be a representation made by the accused person whether by words or in writing in respect of any matter either in the past or present which is false and the person making it knows that it is false or does not believe it to be true.\n
\nIt however does not include reference made to the future. In other words, it is not futuristic. If it relates to the future then this will not amount to false representation. In <i>Inneh v. COP (1959) WRNLR 204</i>, it was held that the giving of a post-dated cheque implies a future representation. But if the drawer has no bank account at the time he issued the cheque then there is a false representation of an existing fact and this will bring the action to the present.\n
\n<i><b>Intent to defraud</b></i>
\n The accused person must have the intention to defraud by the false representation, although the intention to defraud a particular person is not required. If that intention is absent then the offence is not committed. If a person makes a false representation in order to regain his property from a wrongful possessor, this would not amount to obtaining property by false pretence.\n
\n<i><b> Obtaining</b></i>
\n It must be established that the false representation by the accused induced the owner of the property to part with it. The offence therefore presupposes that there must be a person or persons who have acted on the false pretence. See <i>Director of Public Prosecution v. Ray (1973) 3 All ER 131</i>. One can therefore not obtain by false pretence from a machine, e.g. vending machines, as a machine cannot be deceived.\n
\n<i><b> Anything capable of being stolen</b></i>
 \nAs treated under stealing, anything capable of being stolen has the same meaning here. Hence, property capable of being subject of ownership whether living or non-living thing falls under this category. Land therefore cannot be obtained by false pretence. Neither can tree or crops, except where they have been severed from the ground.

    <string name="cheat">Cheating, Receiving Stolen Property</string>
    <string name="cheat1">This is yet another form of stealing. By virtue of <i>section 421 CCA</i>, cheating is committed where a person by means of any fraudulent trick or device obtains from any other person anything capable of being stolen, or induces any other person to deliver to any person anything capable of being stolen or to pay or deliver to any person any money or goods, or any greater sum of money or greater quantity of goods than he would have paid or delivered but for such trick or device\n
\nFor the offence of cheating to be established, there must be the application of fraudulent trick or device used to obtain property. The intent is to fraudulently obtain anything capable of being stolen. See <i>R v. Ogbonna (1941) 7 WACA 139,</i>.\n
\n<b>Making off without payment or bilking</b>
            \n Bilking is the act of refusing to pay for goods or services rendered by walking away having obtained the said goods or service. For the charge of making off to be sustained, there must be a dishonest intent not to make payment for the goods and services received or obtained. It is important to mention that prior agreement will suffice to vitiate the charge of making off. See <i>Vincent (2001) CLR 486</i>\n
\n<b>Conspiracy to defraud</b>
\n By the provision of <i>section 422 CCA</i>, any person who conspires with another by deceit or any fraudulent means to affect the market price of anything publicly sold, or to defraud the public or any person, whether a particular person or not, or to extort any property from any person, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years\n
\n<b>Frauds on sale or mortgage of property</b>
\n Under <i>section 423 CCA</i>, any person who, being a seller or mortgagor of any property, or being the solicitor or agent of any such seller or mortgagor, with intent to induce the purchaser or mortgagee to accept the title offered or produced to him, and with intent to defraud‐\n
\n (1) conceals from the purchaser or mortgagee any instrument material to the title, or any encumbrance; or\n
\n(2) falsifies any pedigree on which the title depends or may depend; or\n
\n (3) makes any false statement as to the title offered or conceals any fact material thereto, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is liable to imprisonment for two years.\n
\nThe mens rea here is the intent to induce as well as to defraud. In a sale or mortgagor of property every material facts are important and must be disclosed. Non-disclosure or partial disclosure is an offence. For a criminal charge to be sustained under this situation, the intent to induce and the intent to defraud must be present.\n
\n<b>Pretending to exercise witchcraft or tell fortunes</b>
\n By <i>section 424 CCA</i>, any person who for gain or reward pretends to exercise or use any kind of witchcraft, juju, sorcery, enchantment, or conjuration, or undertakes to tell fortunes, or pretends from his skill or knowledge in any occult science to discover where or in what manner anything supposed to have been stolen or lost may be found, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is liable to imprisonment for one year.\n
\n<b>RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY</b>
\n It must be understood that under the law, it is not only an offence for anyone to steal but also an offence for anyone to receive a stolen property.\n
\n<i> Section 427 CCA</i> provides that any person who receives anything which has been obtained by means of any act constituting a felony or misdemeanor, or by means of any act done at a place not in Nigeria, which if it had been done in Nigeria would have constituted a felony or misdemeanor, and which is an offence under the laws in force in the place where it was done, knowing the same to have been so obtained, is guilty of a felony.\n
\nFor the purpose of proving the receiving of anything, it is sufficient to show that the accused person has, either alone or jointly with some other person, had the thing in his possession, or has aided in concealing it or disposing of it.\n
\nTo constitute “receiving”, it is sufficient if the person is in actual (physical) possession of the stolen property or if it can be deemed that the person is in possession by virtue of the fact that the stolen property is in possession of someone over whom the person has control or authority. In <i>Olujomoye v. R (1936) 3 WACA 71</i>, the court held thus: ―It is clear that actual possession of goods by a defendant is not necessary to the completion to the offence of receiving. It is sufficient if they are in the actual possession of a person over whom the defendant has a control so that they would be forthcoming if ordered.\n
\nA person will be deemed to have such knowledge if judging from circumstances of the case, a reasonable man ought to have suspected the property in question to have been stolen, for example where the property in question is sold at a ridiculously low price. In <i>R. v. Braimah (1943) W.A.C.A. 197</i>, the accused, a brother to the person who stole the goods, received the goods from his brother soon after a theft in the neighbourhood with the instruction to sell the goods at any rice he deemed fit. Guilty knowledge was inferred and he was held liable for receiving stolen goods.\n
\n<b><i>Doctrine of Recent Possession</i></b>
\n This is a way of referring to the inference of fact which in the absence of any satisfactory explanation by the accused may be drawn as a matter of common sense from the fact that he was in possession of goods recently stolen. This doctrine of recent possession is embodied in <i>section 148 (a) of the Evidence Act 1990 (now section 167(a) Evidence Act of 2011)</i>. That section provides that a court may presume inter alia that a man who is in possession of stolen goods soon after the theft is either the thief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for his possession. If the accused offers explanation which might reasonably be true of how he came by the property and thus raise some doubt, he is entitled to be acquitted because the prosecution would then have failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had guilty knowledge.\n
\nIn <i>R. v. Iyakwe (1944) W.A.C.A. 180</i>, it was held that possession of shoes stolen five months previously was evidence that the accused received them knowing them to have been stolen but not that he himself was the thief.\n
\n<i><b>Punishment</b></i>
\n The punishments for the offence of receiving stolen property are contained in section 427 CCA. If the offence by means of which the thing was obtained is a felony, the receiver is liable to  imprisonment for fourteen years, except in the case in which the thing so obtained was postal matter, or any chattel, money or valuable security contained therein, in which case the receiver is liable to imprisonment for life. In any other case the receiver is liable to imprisonment for seven years\n
\n<b>Having possession of thing reasonably suspected of having been stolen</b>
\n<i> Section 430(1) CC</i> provides that any person who is charged before any court with having in his possession or under his control in any manner or in any place, or for that he at any time within the three months immediately preceding the making of the complaint, did have in his possession or under his control in any manner or in any place, anything which is reasonably suspected of having been stolen or unlawfully obtained, and who does not give an account, to the satisfaction of the court, as to how he came by the same, is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of two hundred naira or to imprisonment for six months.\n
\n<b>Unlawfully using animals or vehicles</b>
\n It is an offence to drive a car belonging to another person without the owner‘s consent. By virtue of <i>section 431 CC</i>, any person who unlawfully uses a horse, mare, gelding, ass, mule, camel, ostrich, bull, cow, ox, ram, ewe, wether, goat, or pig, or the young of any such animal, or any cycle or other vehicle whatsoever without the consent of the owner, or of the person in lawful possession thereof, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is liable to imprisonment for one year, or to a fine of forty naira for every animal or vehicle so used\n
\n<b>Suspicion of stealing animals </b>
\n<i>Section 432 CC</i> provides that when any horse, mare, gelding, ass, mule, camel, ostrich, bull, cow, ox, ram, ewe, wether, goat, or pig, or the young of any of such animal is suspected, on reasonable grounds, to have been stolen, any person in whose possession or custody the skin, feathers or carcass, or any part of the skin or carcass, of the animal or bird so suspected to have been stolen, is found, is guilty of an offence, unless he proves that he came lawfully by the thing in question; and he is liable to a fine of one hundred naira.\n
\n<b>Taking Reward for Recovery of Property Obtained by Means of Felony or Misdemeanour</b>
\n<i>Section 433 CC</i> provides that any person who corruptly receives or obtains, or corruptly agrees to receive or obtain, any property or benefit of any kind upon an agreement or understanding that he will help any person to recover anything which has been obtained by means of any act constituting a felony or misdemeanor, or by means of any act done at a place not in Nigeria, which if it had been done in Nigeria would have constituted an offence, and which is an offence under the laws in force in the place where it was done, is, unless he has used all due diligence to cause the offender to be brought to trial for the offence, guilty of a felony, and liable to imprisonment for seven years.\n
\n<b>Fraudulent false accounting</b>
\n<i> Section 438 CCA</i> provides that any person who, being a clerk or servant, or being employed or acting in the capacity of a clerk or servant, does any of the following acts with intent to defraud‐\n
        \n(a) Destroys, alters, mutilates, or falsifies, any book, document, valuable security, or account, which belongs to or is in the possession of his employer, or has been received by him on account of his employer, or any entry in any such book, document, or account, or is privy to any such act; or\n
\n(b) Makes, or is privy to making any false entry in any such book, document, or account; or\n
\n(c) Omits, or is privy to omitting, any material particular from any such book, document, or account, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.\n
\n<b>Injuries to Property</b>
\n Any act of alteration on any part of a property in a manner that is inconsistent with the original face of the property constitutes an injury to the property. The word injury and damage are sometimes used interchangeably. <i>Section 442 CC.</i> describes the term "damage" used in relation to a document, or to a writing or inscription to include obliterating and rendering illegible, either in whole or in part.\n
\n<b>Arson</b>
\n By virtue of <i>section 443 CC</i>., the offence of arson is said to be committed when any person who willfully sets fire to any of the following things‐\n
\n(a) any building or structure whatever, whether completed or not;\n
\n(b) any vessel, whether completed or not;\n
\n (c) any stack of cultivated vegetable produce, or of mineral or vegetable fuel;\n
\n(d) a mine, or the workings, fittings, or appliances of a mine.\n
\n The offender under these circumstances is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for life.\n
\n<b>Attempts to commit arson</b>
\n The offence of attempts to commit arson is provided for under <i>section 444 CC</i>. By the tenure of that provision, the offence of arson can be said to be constituted where any person:\n
\n(1) attempts unlawfully to set fire to any such thing as is mentioned in section 443 of this Code; or\n
\n(2) willfully and unlawfully sets fire to anything which is so situated that any such thing as is mentioned in section 443 of this Code is likely to catch fire from it.\n
\n<b>Punishment for Arson</b>
\n The penal sanction for the offence of arson is provided for under <i>section 44(2) CC</i>. By virtue of the above provisions, any person found guilty of any of the act stipulated under section 44(1) and (2) CC is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.\n
\n<b> Setting fire to crops and growing plants</b>
 \nBy the provisions of section 445 CC. any person who willfully and unlawfully sets fire to any of the following things‐\n
\n(a) a crop of cultivated vegetable produce, whether standing or cut;\n
\n(b) a crop of hay or grass under cultivation, whether the natural or indigenous products of the soil or not, and whether standing or cut;\n
\n (c) any standing trees, saplings, or shrubs, whether indigenous or not, under cultivation, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.\n
\n<b>FORGERY</b>\n
\n<b> Definition of forgery</b>
\n Forgery is the act of making an illegal copy of something so that it looks genuine for financial gain. Under <i>section 465 CC</i>, a person who makes a false document or writing knowing it to be false, and with intent that it may in any way be used or acted upon as genuine, whether in the State or elsewhere, to the prejudice of any person, or with intent that any person may, in the belief that it is genuine, be induced to do or refrain from doing any act, whether in the State or elsewhere, is said to forge the document or writing\n
\nIt is immaterial in what language a forged document or writing is expressed. It is immaterial that the forger of anything forged may not have intended that any particular person should use or act upon it, or that any particular person should be prejudiced by it, or be induced to do or refrain from doing any act. It is immaterial that the thing forged is incomplete or does not purport to be a document, writing, or seal, which would be binding in law for any particular purpose, if it is so made, and is of such a kind, as to indicate that it was intended to be used or acted upon

Cyber Terrorism: terrorism is the use of terror in the form of violence or threats meant to coerce an individual, group or entity in a manner in which any person could not otherwise lawfully force them to act.In Nigeria, <i>section 2 (c) of the Anti-Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2011</i> defines the act of terrorism to include attacks upon a person‘s life which may cause bodily harm or death, kidnapping as well as destruction of government facilities or private properties in a manner likely to endanger human life or result in economic loss. Cyber terrorism is the use of computers and other electronic devices or technology using internet access to unlawfully use violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious or ideological. <i>Section 18(1) of the Cybercrime (Prohibition Prevention etc.) Act, 2015</i> provides that any person that accesses or causes to be accessed any computer or computer system or network for purposes of terrorism, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to life imprisonment.\n
\n 2. Identity Theft or Impersonation: the term identity theft is defined under <i>section 58 of the Cybercrime (Prohibition Prevention etc.) Act, 2015</i> to mean ―the stealing of somebody else personal information to obtain goods and services through electronic based transaction.By virtue of <i>section 22(1) of the Cybercrime (Prohibition Prevention etc.) Act, 2015</i>, any person who is engaged in the services of any financial institution, and as a result of his special knowledge commits identity theft of its employer, staff, service providers and consultants with the intent to defraud is guilty of an offence and upon conviction shall be sentenced to 7 years imprisonment or N5,000,000.00 fine or both\n
\n3. Child pornography: by virtue of section 23(1) of the Cybercrime (Prohibition Prevention etc.) Act, 2015, any person who intentionally uses any computer system or network in or for— (a) producing child pornography; (b)offering or making available child pornography; (c) distributing or transmitting child pornography; (d) procuring child pornography for oneself or for another person; (e) possessing child pornography in a computer system or on a computer-‐data storage medium: commits an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction–(i) in the case of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) to imprisonment for a term of 10 years or a fine of not more than N20,000,000.00 or to both fine and imprisonment; and (ii) in the case of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection, to imprisonment for a term of not more than 5 years or a fine of not more than N10,000,000.00 or to both such fine and imprisonment. By virtue of subsection (2) of this section, any person who knowingly makes or sends other pornographic images to another computer by way of unsolicited distribution shall be guilty of an offence and upon conviction shall be sentenced to One year imprisonment or a fine of Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira or both.\n
\n4. Cyber stalking: cyber stalking is defined under section 58 of the Cybercrime (Prohibition Prevention etc.) Act, 2015 to mean a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear. It is when a person knowingly or intentionally sends a message or other matter by means of computer systems or network that is grossly offensive, pornographic or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character or causes any such message or matter to be so sent or for the purpose of causing annoyance, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another. Cyber-stalking is a form of online harassment in which the perpetrator uses electronic communications to stalk a victim. This is considered more dangerous than other forms of cyber-bullying because it generally involves a credible threat to the victim\'s safety.\n
\n5. Cybersquatting: the term cybersquatting is defined under <i>section 58 of the Cybercrime (Prohibition Prevention etc.) Act, 2015</i> as the acquisition of a domain name over the internet in bad faith to profit, mislead, destroy reputation, and deprive others from registering the same, if such a domain name is: (i) Similar, identical, or confusingly similar to an existing trade mark registered with the appropriate government agency at the time of the domain name registration: (ii) Identical or in any way similar with the name of a person other than the registrant, in case of a personal name; and (iii) Acquired without right or with intellectual property interests in it. The punishment for cybersquatting is provided for under <i>section 25(1) of the Cybercrime (Prohibition Prevention etc.) Act, 2015</i> which provides that any person who, intentionally takes or makes use of a name, business name, trademark, domain name or other word or phrase registered, owned or in use by any individual, body corporate or belonging to either the Federal, State or Local Governments in Nigeria, on the internet or any other computer network, without authority or right, and for the purpose of interfering with their use by the owner, registrant or legitimate prior user, commits an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term of not more than 2 years or a fine of not more than N5,000,000.00 or to both fine and imprisonment.\n
\n6. Phishing: phishing has to do with obtaining information about a person or corporation with the intention to defraud. This is a kind of internet fraud where a phony email or electronic communication is sent for the purpose of fooling the recipient into believing that the communication is legitimate in order to induce the recipient into providing personally identifiable information and bank or financial account information and password. <i>Section 58 of the Cybercrime (Prohibition Prevention etc.) Act, 2015 </i>defines ―Phishing as the criminal and fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication through emails or instant messaging either in form of an email from what appears from your bank asking a user to change his or her password or reveal his or her identity so that such information can later be used to defraud the user. The punishment for the offence of phishing is provided for under <i>section 32(1) of the Cybercrime (Prohibition Prevention etc.) Act, 2015. </i>By virtue of that provision, any person who knowingly or intentionally engages in computer phishing is liable upon conviction to 3 years imprisonment or a fine of N1,000,000.00 or both.\n
\n7. Malware: malware is a software designed to surreptitiously install itself and commit some actions not intended or desirable by the owner of the computer such as serving unwanted advertising, a virus, the interception of data and information transferred to and from the computer, etc. Basically, malware has to do with the deliberate introduction of viruses into other people‘s computer with intent to corrupt their files or causing damage to critical information stored therein. The penal sanction for this kind of cybercrime is provided for under <i>section 32(3) of the Cybercrime (Prohibition Prevention etc.) Act, 2015</i>. That section provides that any person who engages in malicious or deliberate spread of viruses or any malware thereby causing damage to critical information in public, private or financial institution‘s computers is liable upon conviction to 3 years imprisonment or a fine of N1,000,000.00 or both.\n
\n8. Credit card fraud: the offence of credit card fraud is provided for under <i>section 33(1) of the Cybercrime (Prohibition Prevention etc.) Act, 2015</i>. That section provides that any person who with intent to defraud, uses any access device including credit, debit, charge, loyalty and other types of financial cards, to obtain cash, credit, goods or service commits an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term of not more than 7 Years or a fine of not more than N5,000,000.00 or to both such fine and imprisonment and shall further be liable to payment in monetary terms the value of loss sustained by the owner of the credit card. Credit card has been defined under section 58 of this Act to mean any instrument, token, device, or card, whether known as a charge card or by any other similar name, issued with or without a fee by an issuer for the use of the cardholder in obtaining goods, services, or anything else of value on credit from a creditor or for use in an automated banking device to obtain money or any of the services offered through the device.\n
\n9. Cyber bullying: cyber bullying is an aggressive, intentional act or behaviour that is carried out by a group or an individual, using electronic forms of contact, repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself. Cyber bullying is also called cyber harassment. Cyber bullying allows bullies to easily and anonymously harass victims online. They do this by flaming, harassing, outing, exclusion, impersonation, and stalking. Harmful bullying behavior can include posting rumors, threats, sexual remarks, a victims\' personal information, or pejorative labels (i.e., hate speech). Bullying or harassment can be identified by repeated behavior and an intent to harm. Victims may have lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and a variety of emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed. Cyber-bullies may disclose victims\' personal data (e.g. real name, home address, or workplace/schools) on websites or forums.\n
\n10. Hacking: this simply means to intrude or break into a computer or computer network without authorization by bypassing security measures. It is an act of modifying a computer program in a way that was not originally intended by the developer.\n
\n 11. Software Piracy: this is the act of pirating software for commercial gains without the authorization of the original software developer.\n
\n 12. E-money Laundering: this is the act of putting illegally obtained money into online business so as to make the source legitimate. Money laundering in its simple term is the act of making money that is from illegal sources and use and commingle it with a legal and legitimate enterprise so as to clean the money to appear that proceeds are from a valid enterprise.\n
\n<b>Causes of Cybercrime</b>
\n 1. Inadequate policing of the cyberspace\n
\n2. Lack of proper sensitization on the penal sanction for improper usage of cyberspace\n
\n3. High rate of unemployment\n
\n 4. Greed on the part of the victims. Cyber criminals exploit this opportunity to defraud victims\n
\n5. The desire to score cheap political popularity\n
\n6. The desire to harm the reputation of the victim\n
\n7. Inadequate enforcement of cybercrime regulations is responsible for the impunity with which cybercrimes are committed in Nigeria\n
\n8. Inadequate technology exposure and manpower development among law enforcement agents hinders their ability to track offenders\n
\n9. Corruption on the part of the enforcement agencies in investigating, arresting and prosecuting offenders is also responsible for the high rate of cybercrimes in Nigeria\n
\n10. Peer group influence\n
\n 11. Positive reinforcement\n
\n12. Compromise on the part of the financial institutions like the bank\n
\n13. The availability and the ease of the usage of the internet is a major drive in this type of crime\n
\n14. The tools for perpetrating cybercrime are cheap\n
\n 15. It is a faceless crime. The ease with which offenders can hide their identity and location while on the internet has given impetus to this type of crime. The lack of sensor or tool for verification of the true identity of users and the speed with which information are disseminated on the internet has adversely affected the fight against cybercrime in Nigeria\n
\n16. Lack of confidence on one‘s ability to make wealth through a legitimate means is also responsible for the high rate of cybercrime\n
\n17. Availability of stored data in limited space\n
\n18. The ease which e-evidence are destroyed thereby making investigation and prosecution difficult, encourages this type of crime\n
\n19. Carelessness of some cyber users in protecting their information thereby exposing such confidential information to cyber fraudsters\n
\n20. The get-rich-quick syndrome\n
\n21. The societal condonation of cybercrime. The society appears not to be condemning the actions of these cyber criminals. Hence, internet fraudsters are no longer ashamed to identify themselves as one.\n
\n<b>Effects of Cybercrime</b>
\n 1. It can lead to frustration and death of the victims\n
\n2. It can lead to loss of reputation and goodwill of individuals and corporations with corresponding social economic consequences\n
\n3. It has encouraged the condonation of cybercrime as a means of livelihood in Nigeria\n
\n4. It can lead to huge financial loss to individuals, organizations and government.\n
\n5. It can lead to stigmatization of victims. For example, where the reputation of a victim has been battered through the use of the internet, there is tendency for friends to start voiding him or ostracize same.\n
\n 6. It contributes to unhealthy social exposure such as prostitution, pornography, etc.\n
\n7. It undermines the justice system in Nigeria through lack of effective prosecution of cyber criminals\n
\n8. It has encouraged human trafficking and slavery\n
\n 9. It has damaged the reputation of Nigeria with corresponding reluctance of foreign investors to invest in Nigeria because of the fear of being swindle\n
\n10. It can lead to bankruptcy of a country due to heavy financial loss\n
\n11. It can lead to the stigmatization of Nigerians overseas\n
\n12. Cyber terrorism is a threat to world peace as it provides a fertile platform for the recruitment and training of terrorists Control,\n
\n<b> Prevention and Management of Cybercrimes in Nigeria</b>
\n 1. There should be adequate knowledge and the will on the part of the law enforcement agents to track, investigate arrest and prosecute cyber criminals\n
\n2. There should be proper data protection through effective security of data information\n
\n3. There should be adequate enforcement of cyber regulations in Nigeria\n
\n4. There should be proper sensitization of the populace on the penal sanction of cybercrime\n
\n5. There should be employment and engagement of the masses to discourage them from engaging in cybercrime as they saying goes ―an idle mind is the devil‘s workshop\n
\n6. There should be adequate policing and proper oversight management of the usage of cyberspace to reduce cybercrimes\n
\n7. There should be adequate sensitization on the use and protection of data and information by internet users\n
\n8. Cyber criminals should not be condoned and they should be prevented from holding any public office of position (whether appointive or elective).\n
\n9. Youths should avoid peer pressure or associations that can easily lure them into committing cybercrimes\n
\n10. Law enforcement agents and public officers saddled with the responsibility of enforcing cyber regulations should be severely penalized for their complicity in internet related crimes\n
\n11. Adequate tools should be provided for tracking and prosecution of offenders\n
\n12. There should be proper monitoring of the cyberspace and any intending offender should be denied access.

    <string name="assembly">Unlawful Assembly</string>
    <string name="assembly1"><i>Section 69 CC</i> defined unlawful assembly as: ―When three or more persons, with intent to carry out some common purpose, assemble in such a manner, or, being assembled, conduct themselves in such a manner, as to cause persons in the neighbourhood to fear on reasonable grounds that the persons so assembled will tumultuously disturb the peace, or will by such assembly needlessly and without and any reasonable occasion provoke other person tumultuously to disturb the peace, they are an unlawful assembly\n
\n Where two unlawful groups come together in such a manner that their assemblies would constitute unlawful assembly but with different purposes, each of the group constitutes an unlawful assembly and would be charger separately for the offence of unlawful assembly. Thus, in <i>Amafina v. IGP (1963) 7 ENLR 69</i>, two rival factions supporting different candidates at an election assembled to settle their differences by force, they did not have a common purpose, it was held that it was wrong to join the two unlawful assemblies in one count of an indictment.\n
\nIt is equally important to mention that for an assembly to be unlawful, it is not necessary that those assembled should have the intention to commit any crime; it suffices if the persons are in such in a number that their presence reasonably raises terror and alarm within the neighbourhood.\n
\n<b>Punishment of Unlawful Assembly</b>
\n The punishment for taking part in an unlawful assembly both under the Criminal and Penal Codes is imprisonment for one year. <i>Sections 70 CC</i> provides that any person who takes part in an unlawful assembly is guilty of a misdemeanour and is liable to imprisonment for one year.\n
\n<b>Unlawful assembly under the Public Order Act</b>
\n A law hitherto regulating assemblies, meetings and processions in Nigeria was the Public Order Decree No. 5 of 1979 which repealed all public order laws in the States of the Federation and replaced them with a Federal Act for the purpose of maintaining public order among others. On the return to civil rule in 1999, the law was then codified as an Act of the National Assembly and designated as Public Order Act cap 382 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1990.\n
\nFor the purpose of the Decree, an assembly is defined in section 12(1) as a meeting of five or more persons.\n
\nUnder the law the Governor of each State is charged with the conduct of all assemblies, meetings and processions on public roads and places in the State. Anyone desirous of convening or collecting any assembly or meeting or of forming any procession in such places must first seek and obtain a licence from the Governor. A licence may be issued upon conditions and a breach of this may entitle a superior officer of the police to order the assembly to disperse\n
\nPenalties are imposed for any assembly, meeting or procession which takes place without a licence, or that violates its condition, etc. The Public Order Act has been a controversial law in Nigeria as some have alleged that the police used the law ‗to harass, intimidate and brutalize innocent Nigerians‘, in the process of protesting unpopular policies of government by using excessive force against them, arresting and/or prosecuting those lawfully engaging in peaceful protest or rallies.\n
\nIn this regard, the law has been viewed by many as infringing on the rights of Nigerians to freely assemble and associate with other persons contained in section 40 of the 1999 Constitution. Although the provision of section 40 is subject to section 45(1) which permits any law that is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society, in the interest of defence, public safety, public order, etc., which led the Court of Appeal to affirm the lawfulness of the Public Order Act in <i>Lewis Chukwuma &amp; 2 Ors v. COP [2005] 8 NWLR (Pt. 927) 278</i>.\n
\n Notwithstanding the above decision, it has been contended that it is only in cases of emergency that the right to freely assemble can be restricted and that the provisions of the Act, especially that of requiring people to seek and obtain licence from the police before people can freely assemble is antithetical to a democratic society as it placed a lid on the exercise of a right guaranteed by the Nigerian Constitution. However, in <i>I.G.P. v. A.N.P.P. (2007) 18 N.W.L.R. (Pt. 1066) 457</i> the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja struck down the Public Order Act as impinging on the fundamental rights of Nigerians as guaranteed by the Constitution. The court held that no individual or group of persons requires a police permit or approval to hold rallies and peaceful assembly.\n
\n<b>Unlawful procession</b>
\n The offence of unlawful procession is geared towards the prevention of acts that promote religious animosity or other difference or distinction among people. An offence relating to breach of the peace is that of unlawful procession under <i>section 88(1) CC</i>, which provides: Any persons who assemble together, to the number of three or more, under any of the following circumstances-\n
\n(a) Bearing or wearing or having any firearms or other offensive weapon, etc.; or\n
\n(b) Publicly exhibiting any, emblem, flag, or symbol, which is calculated to promote animosity between persons of different religious faiths or different factions, or\n
\n(c) Being accompanied by any music, beating of drums, etc., calculated to promote such animosity; and, being so assembled, join in any parade or procession for the purpose of celebrating or commemorating any event connected with any religious or difference between persons residing in Nigeria or of demonstrating any such religious or difference, are guilty of an offence; and each of them is liable to imprisonment for one month.\n
\n<b>RIOT</b>\n
\n<b> Definition</b>
 \nThe term “riot” is defined under section 70 CC. that section defines riot thus: “When an unlawful assembly has begun to act in so tumultuous manner as to disturb the peace, the assembly is called a riot, and the persons assembled are said to be riotously assembled‘. Section 105 of the Penal Code defined the offence as whenever force or violence is used in an unlawful assembly, which is essentially the same as defined by the Criminal Code.\n
\nWhere a group of people marched through some streets armed with dangerous weapon thereby causing people in the neighbourhood to fear, and refused to disperse after the making of a proclamation by the police, the offence of riot will be said to be constituted. In <i>R. v. Eyo [1962] 1 All N.L.R. 515</i>, a crowd of about 500 people congregated on a highway, armed with weapons, singing songs and constituting obstruction to the public way. They refused to disperse when requested to do so by the police. The Federal Supreme Court held that the offence of riot was constituted\n
\nIt is important to mention here that rioting is different from peaceful protest. Where a group of people peacefully march through the streets without weapons and without causing people in the neighbourhood to fear, even though the refuse to disperse when requested to do so by the police, such act will not constitute to rioting.\n
\n<b>Punishment of riot</b>
\n It is a criminal offence to take part in a riot. <i>Section 71 CC</i> provides that any person who takes part in a riot is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for three years. Under section 106 of the Penal Code, the punishment is imprisonment up to three years, or with fine or both.\n
\n<b><i>Making proclamation for rioters to disperse</i></b>
\nThe law empowers some categories of persons to make proclamation in order to disperse rioters. <i>Section 72 CC</i> provides that any magistrate or, in his absence, any police officer, of or above the rank of assistant superintendent, or any commissioned officer in the Naval, Military or Air Forces of Nigeria in whose view a riot is being committed, or who apprehends that a riot is about to be committed by persons assembled within his view, may make or cause to be made a proclamation in the name of the Federal Republic in such form as he thinks fit, commanding the rioters or persons so assembled to disperse peaceably. From this provision, it therefore means that not every person can make a proclamation to disperse rioters.\n
\n<b><i>Dispersion of rioters after proclamation made</i></b>
\n<i> Section 73 CC</i>  provides thus: ―If upon the expiration of a reasonable time after such proclamation is made, or after the making of such proclamation has been prevented by force, twelve or more persons continue riotously assembled together, any person authorised to make proclamation, or any police officer, or any other person acting in aid of such person or police officer, may do all things necessary for dispersing the persons so continuing assembled, or for apprehending them or any of them, and, if any person makes resistance, may use all such force as is reasonably necessary for overcoming such resistance, and shall not be liable in any criminal or civil proceeding for having, by the use of such force, caused harm or death to any person.\n
\n<b> Rioting after proclamation</b>
\n By virtue of<i> section 74 CC</i>, if proclamation is made, commanding the persons engaged in a riot, or assembled with the purpose of committing a riot, to disperse, every person who, at or after the expiration of a reasonable time from the making of such proclamation, takes or continues to take part in the riot or assembly is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for five years.\n
\n<b>Preventing or obstructing the making of proclamation</b>
\n<i> Section 75 CC</i> provides that any person who forcibly prevents or obstructs the making of such proclamation as is in the last section mentioned, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for ten years; and if the making of the proclamation is so prevented, every person who, knowing that it has been so prevented, takes or continues to take part in the riot or assembly is liable to imprisonment for five years.\n
\n<b>AFFRAY </b>
\nThe offence of affray is provided for under section 83 CC. that section makes it an offence for any person to take part in a fight in a public place and such a person is liable to imprisonment for one year.\n
\nIt is not necessary that the fight should be such as to alarm the public, provided it occurs in the public place. <i>Section 1 CC</i> defines public place to include any public way (highway, market place, square, street, bridge, or other way, which is lawfully used by the public) and any building, place, or conveyance, to which for the time being the public are entitled or permitted to have access, either without any conditions or upon condition of making any payment, and any building or place which is for the time being used for any public or religious meeting or assembly, or as an open court.\n
\nThe House of Lords held in <i>Button v. DPP (1966) A.C. 591</i>, that under English law the offence was committed even though the fight did not occur in a public place.\n
\n<b>TREASON</b>
\n An offence viewed with all seriousness by the state is that which tends to threaten its stability or safety by acts of levying war against the State. In <i>section 37 CC</i>, it is an offence for any person to levy war against the State in order to intimidate or overawe the President or the Governor of a State. This is covered under <i>section 410 of the Penal Code.</i>\n
\n<b>What constitutes treason?</b>
\n To constitute the act of levying of war, it does not matter the persons charged with treason do not belong to the military or even have special training in the use of arms or that they are small in number. The war the accused persons are charged with must not relate to a private purpose but a general and public one, otherwise the offence may be riot rather than treason. This proposition was given judicial affirmation in the case of <i>R v. Hardle (1821) 1 St. Tr. 609.</i>\n
\n<b>Proof of Treason</b>
\n In proofing the offence of treason, it is not required that the President or Head of State should be personally intimidated or overawed, as intimidating the State also amounts to intimidating the Head of State and vice versa because the Head of State is the embodiment of the State. In <i>R v. Boro [1966] 1 All N.L.R. 266</i>, counsel had argued that to establish the offence of treason under section 37(1) CC, it must be prove that the Head of State was personally intimidated or overawed. Rejecting the argument, the Supreme Court held that there is no difference between intimidating and overawing the State and doing the same to the Head of State. Thus, intimidating the Head of State is tantamount to doing same to the State as the Heads of State is the embodiment of the State.\n
\n<b>Punishment of Treason</b>
\n As a result of the seriousness attached to this offence, its punishment is capital punishment – death, both under the Criminal and Penal Codes. Section 1(1) CC provides that any person who levies war against the State, in order to intimidate or overawe the President or the Governor of a State, is guilty of treason, and is liable to the punishment of death. This is to deter people from engaging in treasonable acts and to maximally punish those that engage in it, and also to preserve the stability and safety of the nation and reign of its leaders.\n
\n<b><i>Concealment of treason - accessory before and after the fact</i></b>
\n By virtue of <i>section 40 CC</i>, it is an offence for anyone to become an accessory after the fact to treason or knowing that treason is to be committed and fail to give such information promptly to the appropriate authority or fails to use other reasonable endeavours to prevent the commission of the offence, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for life.\n
\n An accessory after the fact is someone who helps a criminal after he has committed a crime to avoid arrest or trial, although the helper was present at the place where the offence was committed\n
\n<b>Treasonable felony</b>\n
\n Under <i>section 41 CC</i>, the forming of an intention by any person to levy, instigate or conspire to wage war against the State and/or the President and the manifestation of such intention by an overt act is treasonable felony and is punishable by imprisonment for life.\n
\n<b>Promoting Native War</b>\n
\n Under <i>section 42 CC</i>, any person who, without lawful authority, carries on, or makes preparation for carrying on, or aids in or advises the carrying on of, or preparation for, any war or warlike undertaking with, for, by, or against, any traditional chief, or with, for, by, or against any band of citizens, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for life.\n
\n<b>Time limitation for prosecution of offences</b>
\n Although there is generally no time limitation for the prosecution of a crime in criminal law, there is an exception with respect to treason and related offences, as nobody can be tried for such offences unless the prosecution is commenced within two years after the offence is committed. Section 43 CC, a person cannot be tried for treason, or for any of the felonies defined in the three last preceding sections, unless the prosecution is commenced within two years after the offence is committed.\n
\n<b>Evidence</b>
\n Under <i>section 201(1) of the Evidence Act 2011</i>, in the prosecution of the offences mentioned in sections 40, 41, and 42, nobody can be convicted unless he/she pleads guilty to the offence(s) or there is proof of the commission of such offence(s) by two witnesses in open court of at least one overt act of the type of treason or felony charged with or by two witnesses who are witnesses to different overt acts each of the treason or felony the accused is charged with. This is on the authority of <i>Omisade v. Queen [1964] 1 All N.L.R. 233.</i>

    <string name="sedi">Sedition,Murder etc</string>
    <string name="sedi1"><b>Sedition Defined</b>
\n This is the act of publishing uncomplimentary things against one‘s government with intent to bring the government to disrepute. However, truth or the veracity of the publication is a strong defence in a charge of sedition. Under <i>section 51 (1) CC</i> the offence of sedition is defined thus:\n
\n(1) Any person who‐\n
\n(a) does or attempts to do, or makes any preparation to do, or conspires with any person to do, any act with a seditious intention;\n
\n(b) utters any seditious words;\n
\n(c) prints, publishes, sells, offers for sale, distributes or reproduces any seditious publication;\n
\n(d) imports any seditious publication, unless he has no reason to believe that it is seditious, is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction for a first offence to imprisonment for two years or to a fine of two hundred naira or to both such imprisonment and fine and for a subsequent offence to imprisonment for three years and any seditious publication shall be forfeited for the State.\n
\n(2) Any person who without lawful excuse has in his possession any seditious publication is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction, for a first offence, to imprisonment for one year or to a fine of one  hundred naira or to both such imprisonment and fine, and for a subsequent offence, to imprisonment for two years; and such publication shall be forfeited to the State.\n
\nSedition is provided in <i>section 416 of the Penal Code</i> with punishment up to seven years imprisonment or with fine, or both.\n
\nGenerally, sedition is usually opposed by the public because of its interference with the exercise of free speech by the citizens\n
\nThe court therefore plays a crucial role in clearly defining the limits of the law of sedition in order to protect the right to free speech which is an essential ingredient of a democratic society, including the right to fairly criticize government and its activities. State security and the right to free speech thus ought to be properly balanced in this respect. The limit beyond which free speech must not extend is illustrated by the dictum of Ademola FCJ. in <i>D.P.P. v. Obi [1961] 1 All N.L.R. 186 at 194.</i>\n
\n<b>Seditious intention</b>
\n An essential requirement of this offence is that there must be seditious intention and this has been defined in section 50(2) CC as an intention:\n
\n(a) to bring into hatred or contempt or excite disaffection against the person of the President or of the Governor of a State or the Government of the Federation; or\n
\n(b) to excite the citizens or other inhabitants of Nigeria to attempt to procure the alteration, otherwise than by lawful means, of any other matter in Nigeria as by law established; or\n
\n(c) to raise discontent or disaffection amongst the citizens or other inhabitants of Nigeria; or\n
\n(d) to promote feelings of ill‐will and hostility between different classes of the population of Nigeria. But an act, speech or publication is not seditious by reason only that it intends‐\n
\n(i) to show that the President or the Governor of a State has been misled or mistaken in any measure in the Federation or a State, as the case may be; or\n
\n (ii) to point out errors or defects in the Government or Constitution of Nigeria, or of any State thereof, as by law established or in legislation or in the administration of justice with a view to the remedying of such errors or defects; or\n
\n(iii) to persuade the citizens or other inhabitants of Nigeria to attempt to procure by lawful means the alteration of any matter in Nigeria as by law established; or\n
\n(iv) to point out, with a view to their removal, any matters which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of ill‐will and enmity between different classes of the population of Nigeria.\n
\nHowever, where is it proved that a publication has seditious intention, the fact that such publication contains parts which point the errors or weaknesses in the government with a view to remedying such errors or effecting a change in the party in power will not excuse the publication from being seditious. It was pointed out in <i>I.G.P. v. Anagbogu (1954) 21 NLR 26 at 27</i> that: ―He who writes an article with a seditious intention as defined in (a) to (d) cannot by including in the article criticism which is legitimate under (i) to (iv) be excused from a charge of writing a seditious article… Often enough, a seditious article does contain parts which are not seditious. These parts do not excuse the article from being seditious.\n
\n<b>Proof of seditious intention</b>
\n Seditious intention on the part of the accused can be inferred from either the manner of publication of the alleged seditious words or the language used by the accused, although such seditious words may produce different results depending on the surrounding circumstances or the audience being addressed. In considering whether the language used at a meeting is calculated to raise discontent and disaffection it is legitimate to consider its effect ―on the minds of the ordinary people of this country. In <i>R. v. Aldred (1909) 22 Cox 1</i>, Coleridge J. held thus: ―I arriving at a decision of this test, you are entitled to look at all the circumstances surrounding the publication with the view of seeing whether the language used is calculated to produce the results imputed; that is to say, you are entitled to look at the audience addressed.\n
\n The essential element that you must note here is that, the words used must have the tendency to incite ordinary people to violence. It is however not a defence that the people addressed were unmoved by such words to violence. According to <i>section 50(3) CC,</i> in determining whether the intention with which any act was done, any words were spoken, or any document was published, was or was not seditious, every person shall be deemed to intend the consequences which would naturally follow from his conduct at the time and under the circumstances in which he so conducted himself. This means that, you must take care in ensuring that your act, words or publication is in fact not seditious.\n
\n<b>Defences to charge of sedition</b>
\n 1. Truth of the publication: truth of the publication will only be a defence where no seditious intention is proved. In effect, once the seditious intention is proved, it is no defence to show that the allegations made are true and evidence as to the truth of such allegation has been held inadmissible in <i>Service Press v. A.G. (1952) 14 WACA 176</i>. But the Federal Supreme Court has pointed out in <i>D.P.P. v. Obi</i>  that the truth of the allegations may, in certain circumstances be relevant in showing the real intention of the accused when considering the exceptions contained in the second paragraph of section 50(2) of the Criminal Code.\n
\n2. Denial of seditious intent: apart from the defence of truth, it is up to the accused to defend the alleged seditious words by proving that they are not seditious. This the accused can do by narrating the surrounding circumstances in which the words were uttered or point to other words in the alleged publication negating such intention.\n
\n3. Lawful excuse: also, if someone is charged with being in possession of a seditious publication, it is a defence if he has a lawful excuse for such possession, especially if he is unaware that the publication contained any seditious subject.\n
\n<b>Requirements for prosecution</b>
\n There are requirements to be met before any person can be successfully prosecuted on the charge of sedition. These are spelt out under section 52 CC as follows:\n
\n(1) No prosecution for any seditious offence (under section 51 CC) shall be begun except within six months after the offence is committed;\n
\n(2) A person cannot be prosecuted for sedition (under section 51 CC) without the written consent of the Attorney-General of the Federation or of the State concerned;\n
\n(3) No person shall be convicted of an offence under paragraph (b) of section 1 of section 51 CC (i.e. concerning uttering of seditious words) on the uncorroborated testimony of one\n
\n<b>MURDER</b>
\n Murder is the unlawful killing of a person by another. The legal term for killing of a person, whether lawfully or unlawfully is homicide. By virtue of <i>section 308 CC</i>, any person who causes the death of another, directly or indirectly, by any means whatever, is deemed to have killed that other person.This is defined also in <i>Section 316 CC</i>\n
\n<b>Limitation as to time of death</b>
\n It is trite law that there must be a causal connection between the cause of death and the act or omission of the accused person which caused the death of the deceased. By virtue of <i>section 314 CC,</i> a person is not deemed to have killed another, if the death of that other person does not take place within a year and a day of the cause of death. Such period is reckoned inclusive of the day on which the last unlawful act contributing to the cause of death was done.\n
\n<b>The Mens rea of Murder</b>
\n The mens rea for the offence of murder is the intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm of the person of another. For the prosecution to succeed in a case of murder, it must be established that the accused person intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm of the person of another, in other words, he premeditated the killing of the deceased. In <i>Hyman v. D.P.P. (1974) 2 All E.R. 41</i>, it was held that foresight of death or grievous bodily harm as a highly probable consequences of one‘s action was sufficient to constitute the mental element for murder.\n
\n<b>The Actus Reus of Murder</b>
\n As with all crimes, the actus reus of murder is the external element necessary to constitute the crime of murder which is the causing of death of another by the act of the accused in circumstances which are not authorized, justified or excused by law.\n
\n<b> Punishment for Murder</b>
\n It is a common saying that he who kills by sword, must himself be killed by sword. In effect, it may be translated in this context to mean that he who unlawfully kills another must himself be killed. In Nigeria, the punishment for the offence of murder is death. This is provided for under <i>section 319(1) CC.</i> that section provides thus: ―Subject to the provisions of this section of this Code, any person who commits the offence of murder shall be sentenced to death.\n
\n<b>Juvenile offender</b>
\n<i> Section 319(2) CC</i> provides that where an offender who in the opinion of the court had not attained the age of seventeen years at the time the offence was committed, has been found guilty of murder, such offender shall not be sentenced to death but shall be ordered to be detained during the pleasure of the President and upon such an order being made the provisions of Part 44 of the Criminal Procedure Act shall apply. A similar provision is made under <i>section 405 ACJA 2015</i>. That section provides that where a convict who, in the opinion of the court, had not attained the age of 18 years at the time the offence was committed is found guilty of a capital offence, sentence of death shall not be pronounced or recorded but in lieu of it, the court shall sentence the child to life imprisonment or to such other term as the court may deem appropriate in consideration of the principles set out in section 401 of this Act. That section concerns adopting the objectives of sentencing that is appropriate or even possible such as prevention, restraint, rehabilitation, deterrence, education, retribution, restitution, etc\n
\n<b>Pregnant woman</b>
\n By <i>section 319(3) CC</i>, where a woman who has been convicted of murder alleges she is pregnant or where the judge before whom she is convicted considers it advisable to have inquiries made as to whether or not she be pregnant, the procedure laid down in section 376 of the Criminal Procedure Act shall first be complied with. On the authority of <i>section 404 ACJA 2015</i>, where a woman found guilty of a capital offence is pregnant, the sentence of death shall be passed on her but its execution shall be suspended until the baby is delivered and weaned.\n
\n<b>Manslaughter</b>
\n The line of difference between murder and manslaughter is that the latter is not intended. <i>Section 317 CC</i> provides that any unlawful killing in circumstances which, but for the provisions of this section of this Code, would constitute murder which do not constitute murder is manslaughter constitutes the offence of manslaughter\n
\n<b>The Punishment for Manslaughter</b>
\n The punishment for manslaughter is provided for under section 325 CC. that section provides that any person who commits the offence of manslaughter, is liable to imprisonment for life.\n
        \n<b>OFFENCES AGAINST MORALITY</b>
\n Unnatural offences Unnatural offences include such offences as sodomy (anal intercourse) and bestiality (having carnal knowledge of an animal). The offence of unnatural offence is provides for under <i>section 214(1) – (3) CC</i>. That section provides that any person who ‐ (1) has carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature; or (2) has carnal knowledge of an animal; or (3) permits a male person to have carnal knowledge of him or her against the order of nature, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.\n
\n<b>Attempt to commit unnatural offences</b>
\n By the provision of section 215 CC, any person who attempts to commit any of the offences defined in section 214 of this Code, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.\n
\n <b>Indecent Treatment</b>
        \n<i><b>Section 216 CC</b></i> deals with indecent treatment of boys under fourteen. That section provides that any person who unlawfully and indecently deals with a boy under the age of fourteen years, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years. The term "deal with" includes doing any act which, if done without consent, would constitute an assault as hereinafter defined.\n
        \n<i><b>Section 217</b></i> CC deals with indecent practices between males. That section provides that any male person who, whether in public or private, commits any act of gross indecency with another male person, or procures another male person to commit any act of gross indecency with him, or attempts to procure the commission of any such act by any male person with himself or with another male person, whether in public or private, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for three years.

    <string name="sexual">Sexual Offences</string>
    <string name="sexual1"><b>These offences include defilement, rape, </b>
\n<b>Defilement of girls under thirteen</b>
 \nThe offence of defilement of girls under thirteen is provided for under section 218 CC. That section provides that any person who has unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of thirteen years is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for life, with or without caning.\n
\n<b>Defilement of girls under sixteen and above thirteen, and of idiots </b>
\nThis offence is provided for under <i>section 221 CC</i>. that section provides that any person who‐ (1) has or attempts to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl being of or above thirteen years and under sixteen years of age; or (2) knowing a woman or girl to be an idiot or imbecile, has or attempts to have unlawful carnal knowledge of her, is guilty of a misdemeanour and is liable to imprisonment for two years, with or without caning.\n
\n<b>Time Limit for Prosecution</b>
\n By the proviso to <i>section 221 CC</i>, a prosecution for any of the offences defined in this section of this Code shall be begun within two months after the offence is committed. The rationale for this provision is to ensure that evidences are not destroyed due to time lag.\n
\n<b>Requirement for Proof</b>
        \n For a person to be convicted of any of the offence of defilement, the claim must be substantiated by the testimony of at least one witness. The proviso to section 221 CC provides that a person cannot be convicted of any of the offences defined in this section of this Code upon the uncorroborated testimony of one witness. See <i><b>Upahar v. The State – at pages 231 – 232 of Aigbokhaevbo‘s book Procuration</b></i>\n
\n<i> Section 223 CC</i> provides that any person who - (1) procures a girl or woman who is under the age of eighteen years to have unlawful carnal connection with any other person or persons either in Nigeria or elsewhere; or (2) procures a woman or girl to become a common prostitute either in Nigeria or elsewhere; or (3) procures a woman or girl to leave Nigeria with intent that she may become an inmate of a brothel elsewhere; or (4) procures a woman or girl to leave her usual place of abode in Nigeria, with intent that she may, for the purposes of prostitution, become an inmate of a brothel either in Nigeria or elsewhere, is guilty of a misdemeanour and is liable to imprisonment for two years.\n
        \n A person cannot be convicted of any of the offences defined in this section of this Code upon the uncorroborated testimony of one witness.\n
\n<b>Abduction of girl under eighteen with intent to have carnal knowledge</b>\n
\n The offence of Abduction of girl under eighteen with intent to have carnal knowledge is provided for under section 225 CC. That section provides that any person who, with intent that an unmarried girl under the age of eighteen years may be unlawfully carnally known by any man, whether a particular man or not, takes her or causes her to be taken out of the custody or protection of her father or mother, or other person having the lawful care or charge of her, and against the will of such father or mother or other person, is guilty of a misdemeanour and is liable to imprisonment for two years. It is a defence to a charge of any of the offences defined in this section of this Code to prove that the accused person believed, on reasonable grounds, that the girl was of or above the age of eighteen years.\n
\n<b>Abduction of a female of any age</b>\n
\n<i> Section 361 CC</i> provides that any person who, with intent to marry or carnally know a female of any age, or to cause her to be married, or carnally known by any other person, takes her away, or detains her against her will, is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for seven years. Abduction of girls under sixteen\n
\nBy <i><b>section 362 CC</b></i>, any person who unlawfully takes an unmarried girl under the age of sixteen years out of the custody or protection of her father or mother or other person having the lawful care or charge of her, and against the will of such father or mother or other person, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is liable to imprisonment for two years. Ignorance of age of girl, or consent, no defence\n
\nIt is imperative to mention that under the offence of abduction, ignorance of age of the girl or consent will not constitute a valid defence. <i>Section 363 CC</i> provides that in the case of proceedings in respect of an offence under section 362 of this Code‐ (a) it is immaterial that the offender believed the girl to be of or above the age of sixteen years; (b) it is immaterial that the girl was taken with her own consent or at her own suggestion. The rationale for this provision is that a girl under the age of sixteen is considered incapable of giving valid consent. In this case, her consent is vitiated by her age.\n
\n<b>RAPE</b>
        \n\t The offence of rape is defined under<i><b>section 357 CC</b></i>. That section defines rape thus: ―Any person who has unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman or girl, without her consent, or with her consent, if the consent is obtained by force or by means of threats or intimidation of any kind, or by fear of harm, or by means of false and fraudulent representation as to the nature of the act, or, in the case of a married woman, by personating her husband, is guilty of an offence which is called rape.\n
\n<b> Mens Rea of Rape</b>
\n The mens rea of rape is the intention to have sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent. Sexual intercourse must be consensual and not obtained by fear, force or fraud, or threat of intimidation or false representation. In effect, consent obtained by fraud, threats or intimidation is not consent. Thus, in <i>R v. Williams (1920) 1 K.B. 340</i>, W, a choir master had intercourse with a 16 year old chorister on the pretence that it was a medical operation to create an air passage to improve her voice projection. The girl, who trusted W, was completely ignorant of sexual matters and so her consent to what occurred was ineffective, she had been raped. In the offence of rape, it is necessary to prove that there was lack of consent by the victim. However, it is not necessary that the accused used force against the victim. In effect, the offence of rape can be constituted even when the victim submitted to the act of the accused. The fact that the victim submits to the act does not necessarily mean that she consented. She could have submitted as a result of treat or intimidation, without having a choice in the matter. In Olugboja v. R (1982) Q.B. 320, the court held that it is not necessary for the use of force to be proved to negative consent.\n
\nConsent induced by fear of violence is not consent and any sexual intercourse which occurs under such circumstance would be regarded as rape. In <i>Jheeta v. R (2007) E.W.C.A. Crim. R. 1699</i>, the defendant generated phone calls and text messages to intimidate the complainant and then pretended to be protecting her. When she broke up her relationship with him, he caused more phone calls to be made to her, informing her that he has becoming suicidal, and that unless she resumes sexual relationship with him, he was going to kill himself. On this basis, the complainant resumed sexual relationship with the defendant. It was held that rape had occurred.\n
\n<b>Capacity to Give Consent</b>
\n Drugged consent is no consent. Where a substance capable of stupefying a complainant is administered to her so as to secure her consent, any purported consent given under such circumstance would be vitiated. Similarly, infants lack the requisite mentis to give consent. People who are mentally or physically ill are presumed to lack mental capacity to give consent. A drunken consent is no consent. However, where both parties are under the influence of alcohol and sexual intercourse occurs, there cannot be said to be rape as the mens rea to commit rape is lacking under such circumstance.\n
\n<b>Rape as Between Husband and Wife</b>
\n Under the Nigeria criminal justice system, there can be no spouser rape. In other words, a husband cannot be accused for raping his wife. However, where a third party is involved, a husband can be convicted for aiding and abetting the rape of his wife. Where a woman aids a man to have unhindered access to a young girl, she can be convicted for aiding and abetting rape.\n
\n<b>Punishment of rape</b>
        \n By virtue of <i><b>section 358 CC</b></i>, any person who commits the offence of rape is liable to imprisonment for life, with or without caning.\n
\n<b>Attempt to commit rape</b>
        \nUnder <i><b>section 359 CC</b></i>, any person who attempts to commit the offence of rape is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years, with or without caning.
\n<b>Indecent assaults on females</b>
\n By virtue of section 360 CC, any person who unlawfully and indecently assaults a woman or girl is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is liable to imprisonment for two years.
